  Tenure-Track Assistant Professorship in Foundations of Computer Science
</h1>

<p>
  The Department of Computer Science at Lund University
  <!--   invites  applications for a -->
  will soon open a 
  <strong>
    tenure-track assistant professorship in the foundations of
    computer science, with a focus on logic and automated reasoning. 
  </strong>
</p>

<h2>The Scientific Environment</h2>

<p>
  The assistant professor will be working at the
  <a href="https://cs.lth.se/">Department of  Computer Science</a>,
  where research into the foundations of computer science is conducted by professors
  <a href="https://derezende.github.io/">Susanna de Rezende</a>
  and
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Jakob Nordström</a>.
  Jakob Nordström leads the research group
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Mathematical
  Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a>,
  which is also active at the University of Copenhagen.

  The research has a unique profile in that it spans a wide range
  of questions from the theoretical, mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation all the way to state-of-the-art practical
  algorithms for real-world problems. This creates a very special
  environment, where the research projects do not only go deep into
  different theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines
  of research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting
  synergies often arise. Much of the research activities revolve
  around powerful algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean
  satisfiability (SAT) solving, Gröbner basis computations, integer
  linear programming, and constraint programming. The study of such
  methods leads to classical questions in computational complexity
  theory—though often with new, fascinating twists—but also involves
  work on devising clever algorithms that can exploit the power of
  such paradigms in practice.
</p>

<h2>Position Profile</h2>

<p>
  The position focuses on algorithms for foundational problems within
  logic, automated reasoning, and combinatorial optimization. This
  includes design and implementation of algorithms for 
  computational problems within Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving,
  constraint programming, mixed integer linear programming, and/or
  satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving. In addition to
  algorithm construction, another topic of interest is to develop a
  scientific understanding of the practical performance of automated
  reasoning algorithms, and to investigate relations between empirical
  observations and theoretical results in algorithm analysis and
  computational complexity theory. Yet another related area concerns
  methods of ensuring that algorithms compute provably correct
  results, which can be used to develop trustworthy solvers for
  automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.  
</p>

<!--
<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  The tenure track assistant professor must have an academic standing
  showing internationally competitive research, and/or have
  internationally recognized high potential to make a future impact.

  The duties of the tenure-track assistant professor will primarily
  consist of research, including obligations with regard to
  publication/scientific communication and research-based teaching
  with associated examination obligations within theoretical computer
  science. To a limited extent the position may also include other
  duties.
</p>



<p>
  The position is open from September&nbsp;1, 2021, or as soon as
  possible thereafter, though the exact starting date is negotiable.
</p>

<p>
  The working language of the Algorithms and Complexity Section is
  English, and knowledge of English is also fully sufficient to
  navigate every-day life in Denmark in general. It might also be
  worth mentioning that Denmark routinely scores at the absolute top
  in rankings of quality of life such as, e.g., the
  <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/">OECD Better Life Index</a>.
</p>

-->

<!--
<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>
  The successful candidate should have:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A PhD degree in computer science, mathematics, or equivalent.
    <li>
      Demonstrated strength within computational complexity theory with
      a solid publication record in leading conferences such as STOC,
      FOCS, SODA, CCC, and ICALP, and/or in journals such as JACM and
      SICOMP. Interdisciplinary work applying complexity theory to other
    areas is viewed as an additional asset but is not necessary.
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  Assessment of applicants will primarily consider their level of
  documented, internationally competitive research. The ability to
  attract external funding will be considered together with outreach
  qualifications. Teaching qualifications are not mandatory but
  documented teaching qualifications and teaching experience will be
  considered.
</p>

<h2>Workplace</h2>

<p>
  Lund University was founded in 1666 and is repeatedly ranked among the
  top 100 universities in the world. Lund Technical College (LTH) forms
  the Faculty of Engineering at Lund University, where research of
  the highest international standard is conducted.
</p>

<p>  
  The
  <a href="http://cs.lth.se/english/">Department of Computer Science</a>
  at LTH is a partner in the
  <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI,
    Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>,
  which is Sweden's largest ever individual research program and
  addresses research on artificial intelligence broadly construed,
  and also in the
  <a href="https://elliit.se/?l=en">ELLIIT Excellence Centre</a>
  focused on basic and applied research in information technologies.
  Furthermore, there are extensive collaborations with the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>,
  the
  <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen (ITU)</a>,
  and the
  <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>
  on the other side of the Öresund Bridge.

  In particular, all current researchers working on the foundations of
  computer science at the Department of Computer Science at LTH
  are also affiliated with the
  <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/ac/">Algorithms and
    Complexity Section</a>
  at the 
  <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/">Department of Computer
    Science (DIKU)</a>
  at the University of Copenhagen,
  which hosts the world-leading
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen
    (BARC) centre</a>.
