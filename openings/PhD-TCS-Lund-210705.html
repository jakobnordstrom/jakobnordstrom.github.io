  The Department of Computer Science at
  Lund University
  invites  applications for
  a
  <strong>
    <!-- postdoc positions -->
    PhD position in
    theoretical computer science. 
    <!-- computer science focused on SAT solving and combinatorial optimization. -->
  </strong>

</p><p>

  </p><h2>Job Description</h2>
  
<p>
  
  The
  <!-- postdoctoral researchers -->
  PhD student
  will be working in the
  <a href="https://www.csc.kth.se/~jakobn/miao-group/">Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group</a>
  headed by
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>,
  which is active at both Lund University and the University of
  Copenhagen on either side of the Öresund Bridge.
  
</p>
<p>
  The MIAO research group has a fairly unusual profile in that we are
  doing cutting-edge research both on the theoretical, mathematical
  foundations of efficient computation and on state-of-the-art applied
  algorithms for real-world problems.
  Much of the  activities of the group revolve around powerful algorithmic
  paradigms such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving,
  GrÃ¶bner basis computations, integer linear programming, constraint
  programming, and semidefinite programming. This leads to classic
  questions in computational complexity theory—though often with
  new, interesting twists—but also involves work on devising new
  algorithmic approaches that can exploit the power of such paradigms
  in practice.
</p>

<p>
  On the theory side, most of our work is in proof complexity, i.e., the
  study of formal systems for reasoning about logic formulas and other
  types of problems from the point of view of computational
  complexity. Proof complexity has connections to foundational questions
  in computational complexity theory, but another important motivation
  is algorithm analysis. All algorithms use some kind of method of
  reasoning to compute solutions to problems, and proof complexity can
  be used to analyse the potential and limitations of such methods (and
  thereby of the algorithms using them). As often happens in theoretical
  computer science, our research has revealed deep,
  and often quite surprising, connections to other areas such as, e.g.,
  circuit complexity, communication complexity, hardness of
  approximation, and finite model theory,
  <!-- and so we are also interested in such areas. -->
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
  and therefore researchers in these or other related areas are more
  than welcome to apply.
  -->
  <!-- PhD -->
  and so the research activities might well involve also such areas.
</p>

<p>
  On the practical side, we want to gain a more rigorous scientific
  understanding, and improve the performance, of state-of-the-art
  solvers for combinatorial optimization problems.  We are
  particularly interested in harnessing powerful mathematical tools
  such as GrÃ¶bner bases or 0-1 integer linear programming (also known
  as pseudo-Boolean solving) to achieve exponential improvements in
  performance, which seems possible in theory but has so far been hard
  to achieve in practice.

  Our most active line of work right now is focusing on combining
  ideas from pseudo-Boolean solving, MaxSAT solving, mixed integer
  linear programming (MIP), and constraint programming (CP) to
  construct new combinatorial solvers that have the potential to go
  significantly beyond the current state of the art.
</p>


<p>
  Another research area of interest is how to verify the correctness
  of state-of-the-art algorithms for combinatorial optimization. Such
  algorithms are often highly complex, and even mature commercial
  solvers are known to sometimes produce wrong results.
  We want to 

  redesign state-of-the-art combinatorial solvers to
  make them certifying, i.e., so that they output not only a solution
  but also a simple, machine-verifiable proof that the claimed
  solution is correct and complete—this is also known as proof
  logging.  Importantly, such machine-verifiable proofs should be
  very easy to generate and should require low overhead on the solver
  side, but should at the same time be very easy to check efficiently,
  and should provide 100% formal guarantees of correctness.
</p>


<p></p>
<p>

  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
      Within the overall framework sketched above, the postdocs will be
      expected and encouraged to contribute to and influence the research
      agenda. Taking part in teaching graduate seminar courses is
      encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and the
      group also receives visitors on a regular basis.
    -->
  
</p>
<p>
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!-- 
  These postdoc positions are full-time employed positions for one
  year with a possible (and expected) one-year extension. The expected
  starting date is September 2020, although this is to some extent
  negotiable.
    -->
</p>


<p>
  <!-- PhD -->

  This is a four-year full-time employed position, but PhD positions
  usually (though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case
  they are prolonged for one more year.

  <!--
  The expected starting date is September 2021, although this is to
  some extent negotiable.
  -->
  
  The starting date is negotiable but should ideally be as early as
  possible during the autumn of 2021.

  The position is fully funded and comes with a competitive salary.

</p>


<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>

<!-- POSTDOC -->
<!--

  Applicants should have or be about to receive a PhD degree in a
  subject relevant for the research area, and should have a passionate
  interest in research. The successful candidate is expected to have a
  solid background in computer science in general and SAT solving or
  neighbouring areas such as CP or MIP in particular, and preferably
  also mathematics, and should have a strong research record as
  witnessed by publications in conferences such as AAAI, IJCAI, SAT,
  CP, or similar, or in journals of a comparable quality. Problem
  solving skills and creativity are a must. Excellent programming
  skills are crucial.
-->
</p>
<p>
  <!-- PhD -->

  To be eligible to apply for this position, applicants need to have
  or be close to obtaining either an MSc degree or a 4-year BSc
  degree. A suitable background is, for instance, a degree in computer
  science, mathematics, electrical engineering, or possibly
  technical physics with a theoretical specialization.
</p>

<p>
  The successful candidate is expected to have a strong background and
  passionate interest in computer science and mathematics. Problem
  solving skills and creativity are a must.
  <!--
  Practical programming skills are also very important.
    -->  
</p>

<p>
  Applicants need to be be strongly motivated for doctoral studies;
  should possess the ability to work independently and perform
  critical analysis, and are also required to have good cooperative
  and communicative abilities. A good command of English in writing
  and speaking is needed to be able to participate in international
  collaborations and to publish and present research results in
  international conferences and journals.
</p>

<p>  
  The working language of the group is English, and knowledge of
  English is also fully sufficient to navigate
  every-day life
  <!-- life in Sweden and Denmark -->
  in general. It might also be worth mentioning that Scandinavian
  countries routinely score at the absolute top in rankings of quality
  of life such as, e.g., the
  <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/">OECD Better Life Index</a>.
