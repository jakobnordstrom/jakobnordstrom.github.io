<h2>The Scientific Environment</h2>

<!-- MIAO TEXT -->

<p>
  We are looking for an outstanding junior researcher with an
  innovative mindset and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and
  complement the research profile of the
<!--  
  The
  PhD student
  will be working in the
  -->
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group</a>
  headed by
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>,
  which is active at both Lund University and the University of
  Copenhagen on either side of the Öresund Bridge.
</p>

<p>
  The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment,
  where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different
  theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of
  research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting
  synergies often arise.

  Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful
  algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
  solving, Gr&ouml;bner basis computations, integer linear
  programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical
  questions in computational complexity theory&mdash;though often with
  new, fascinating twists&mdash;but also involves work on devising
  clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in
  practice.

  Our most recent new line of research is on how to verify the
  correctness of state-of-the-art algorithms for combinatorial
  optimization. Such algorithms are often highly complex, and even
  mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes produce wrong
  results. Our work on designing a new generation of
  <em>certifying</em> combinatorial solvers, which output not only an
  answer but also a machine-verifiable mathematical proof that this
  answer is correct, has already led to several prestigious
  international awards, but many more exciting problems are still
  waiting to be solved!
</p>

<p>
  We are fortunate to be part of the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen
    (BARC) centre</a>,
  which is a world-leading research environment in algorithms and
  complexity theory.
  BARC aims to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious,
  creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of
  mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in
  algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational
  research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic
  discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
</p>


<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  <!--  PhD -->
  <!--
  With this call, we are mainly looking for a mathematically gifted
  PhD student with excellent programming skills to continue our
  ground-breaking work on certifying algorithms, funded by the
  <a href="http://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI,
    Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>.
  -->

  <!-- Postdoc -->
  With this call, we are mainly looking for a researcher with strong
  mathematical background combined with excellent algorithmic thinking
  and programming skills to further expand our world-leading work on
  certifying algorithms.
  
  There is some flexibility as to what kind of research
<!--
    PhD students in
  -->
  members of
  the group pursue, though, and all candidates are welcome, both
  those who want to go deep into either theory or practice and those
  who are inspired by the challenge of bridging the gap between the
  two.

  Please see
  <a href="../miao-group/index.html#about">the description of the MIAO group</a>
  to learn more about our work.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  On the theory side, most of our work is in proof complexity, which studies
  formal systems for reasoning about logic formulas and other types of
  problems.

  Proof complexity has connections to foundational questions in
  computational complexity theory, but also plays an important role in
  algorithm analysis by providing a rigorous understanding of the
  power and limitations of different algorithmic approaches.

  As often happens in theoretical
  computer science, our research has revealed deep,
  and often quite surprising, connections to other areas such as, e.g.,
  circuit complexity, communication complexity,
  and hardness of approximation,
-->
  <!-- and so we are also interested in such areas. -->
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
  and therefore researchers in these or other related areas are more
  than welcome to apply.
  -->
  <!-- PhD -->
<!--
  and so the research activities might well involve also such areas.
</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
  On the practical side, we want to gain a more rigorous scientific
  understanding, and improve the performance, of modern algorithms for
  automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.

  We are particularly interested in designing algorithms that can
  exploit sophisticated mathematical techniques to achieve exponential
  improvements in performance compared to the current state of the
  art&mdash;something that theoretical research suggests should be
  possible, but that has so far been hard to achieve in practice.
</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
  Quite recently, we have also made some breakthrough research on how to
  verify the correctness of state-of-the-art algorithms for
  combinatorial optimization. Such algorithms are often highly
  complex, and even mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes
  produce wrong results.

  Our goal is to design a new generation of <em>certifying</em>
  combinatorial solvers with so-called <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the solvers output not only a answer but also a
  machine-verifiable proof that is easy to check and provides 100%
  formal guarantees that the claimed answer is correct.
</p>
-->

<p></p>
<p>

  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  Within the overall framework sketched above, the postdoc will be
  expected and encouraged to contribute to and influence the research
  agenda. Taking part in teaching graduate seminar courses is
  encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and the
  group also receives visitors on a regular basis.
  
  
</p>
<p>
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  Our postdoc positions are full-time employed positions for two years.


  <!-- PhD Lund -->
  <!--
  Our PhD positions are four-year full-time employed positions, but they
  usually (though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case
  they are prolonged for one more year.
-->

  <!-- STARTING DATE -->
  
  The starting date is negotiable, but should ideally be
  in August-September 2026 or earlier.
  
  All positions in the research group are fully funded, employed
  positions (including travel money) that come with an internationally
  competitive salary.
</p>


<h2>Qualifications</h2>
