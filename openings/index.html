Thesis Projects
</h2>

<p>
  I would be interested in supervising students for thesis work on
  topics as briefly outlined below.

  Please  note that the descriptions are in no way intended to be exhaustive.
  You can 
  <a href="mailto:jn~at-sign~di~dot~ku~dot~dk">send me an e-mail</a>
  to get more detailed information with an up-to-date list of more
  concrete proposals.
  
  
  (Note, however, that these projects are intended for students who are
  geographically close and can work on their thesis in the
  Copenhagen-Lund area.  There is no dedicated funding available to
  support foreign students to come to Denmark or Sweden.)

</p><p>
  
  These projects are intended to give students a feel for what research
  in computer science is like, while at the same time focusing on
  concrete problems of both theoretical and practical importance. Apart
  from the thesis work itself, the intention is that the results
  of successful thesis projects should also be exciting enough to
  be published as (parts of) papers in leading scientific
  conferences and/or journals in the field (within the framework of the
  research outlined
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">here</a>). 
  
</p><p>
  
  </p><h3><a name="formula-hardness"></a>Formula Hardness and SAT Solving</h3>

<p>
  Given a formula in propositional logic, is it possible to set its
  variables in such a
  way that the formula is satisfied? This simple looking problem has
  been on centre stage in theoretical computer science ever since the
  field got started some 40 years ago, and has been named as one of the
  <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems">Millennium Prize Problems</a>
  comprising some of the major challenges for all of mathematics 
  in the 21st century. 
  Today, students of computer science worldwide learn in their
  introductory algorithms and complexity courses that this so-called SAT problem
  is what is known as <em>NP</em>-complete, 
  and therefore is very, very hard in practice. 
  
</p>
<p>
  
  Interestingly, practioners take a somewhat different view.  During the
  last 20 years, SAT has developed from a problem of mainly theoretical
  interest into a practical approach for solving a wide range of applied
  problems.  Enormous progress in performance has led to satisfiability
  algorithms, so-called SAT solvers, becoming a standard tool for
  solving real-world problems with millions of variables in the context
  of, for example, hardware and software verification, electronic design
  automation, artificial intelligence, operations research, and
  bioinformatics.
  
  The theory of <em>NP</em>-completeness did not quite go away, however
  — for all these SAT solvers there are also known examples of
  tiny formulas with just a couple of hundred variables that make them
  fail miserably.
  
</p>
<p>
  
  How can modern SAT solvers be so good in practice? How can one know
  for a particular formula whether it will be hard or easy?  Can we
  extend SAT solvers with new methods of reasoning to make them
  potentially even more powerful than the best solvers today?  These are
  the kind of questions we want to study in these Master's thesis
  projects, using a mix of theoretical research and practical
  experiments.
  
</p>

<h3><a name="ilp"></a>Solving 0-1 Integer Linear Programs</h3>

<p>

  A 0-1 integer linear program (ILP) is a collection of linear constraints

</p><p>

  <em>
    a<sub>1</sub> x<sub>1</sub> + a<sub>2</sub> x<sub>2</sub> + &hellip; +  a<sub>n</sub> x<sub>n</sub> &#8805; A
  </em>

</p><p>

  where all <em>a<sub>i</sub></em> and A are integers and the variables
  <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> can only take values 0 or 1. Such 0-1 ILPs can
  be used to model a vast range of problems in computer hardware
  construction and verification, software analysis, scheduling,
  logistics, disaster management, bioinformatics, artificial
  intelligence, et cetera.

</p><p>

  Most of these problems are known to be computationally very, very
  challenging from a theoretical point of view — it is widely believed
  that it is impossible to design general-purpose algorithms that will
  always run fast and produce correct solutions — but in practice
  there are very efficient combinatorial optimization solvers that try
  to exploit the structure of concrete problems to find shortcuts, and
  use an array of sophisticated heuristics to do so. For most of these
  heuristics there is an almost complete lack of rigorous scientific
  understanding of when and why they work well or fail, however.

</p><p>


  Another intriguing fact is that recent research on combining methods
  from Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, pseudo-Boolean solving,
  and mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) has shown that adding
  together solving techniques from these different areas can lead to
  major improvements in performance.

</p><p>

  A project in this area could involve:

  </p><ul>

    <li>
      Reading up on the literature on SAT solving and pseudo-Boolean solving, focusing on conflict-driven search.

    </li><li>      
      Identifying one or a couple of aspects of combinatorial solvers
      to investigate further, such as, for instance, (a)&nbsp;how to
      vary the methods for learning constraints during so-called
      conflict analysis, (b)&nbsp;how to assess the quality of the
      linear constraints learned (when prioritizing which ones to keep
      or throw away), (c)&nbsp;how to choose variables for branching,
      (d)&nbsp;how to perform restarts during search, (e)&nbsp;how to
      integrate different MIP solving techniques such as linear
      programming relaxations, et cetera.

    </li><li>
      Implementing some different heuristics for the aspect(s) identified,
      and run experiments on benchmark 0-1 ILPs to see how solver
      performance is affected (which can be measured in terms of running
      time, search quality, memory usage, and possibly also other
      parameters).

    </li><li>
      For the benchmarks emanating from research papers in computational
      complexity theory, possibly compare the practical performance with the
      known theoretical properties of these benchmarks to see if and how
      they match up.
  </li></ul>
