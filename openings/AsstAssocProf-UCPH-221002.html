  Tenure-Track Assistant or Associate Professorship in Computational Complexity Theory
</h1>

<p>
  The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen
  invites  applications for a
  <strong>
    tenure-track assistant or associate professorship in computational complexity theory.
  </strong>
</p>

<h2>The Scientific Environment</h2>
  
<p>
  We are looking for an outstanding researcher with an
  innovative mind-set and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and
  complement the research profile of the
  <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/ac/">Algorithms and Complexity Section</a>
  at DIKU.
  This is a world-leading research environment
  with a strong presence at top-tier conferences like STOC, FOCS, CCC,
  and SODA, and also with publications in premier AI conferences like
  AAAI, IJCAI, and NeurIPS. We are home to the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>,
  joint with the
  <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a>,
  and have extensive collaborations with the
  <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>
  and with
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>
  on the Swedish side of the &Oslash;resund
  Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top
  talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative,
  collaborative, and fun environment.

  Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental
  breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory.

  While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track
  record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major
  industrial applications.
</p>


<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  This is a position in theoretical computer science, or, more
  specifically, in computational complexity theory. Candidates are expected
  to publish in the premier venues within theoretical computer science,
  such as STOC, FOCS, and CCC, or in journals of comparable quality, such
  as JACM or SICOMP. Interdisciplinary work applying complexity theory to
  other areas is viewed as an additional asset but is not necessary.
</p>

<p>
  Work duties include own research, development of the scientific field,
  research assessment tasks, research grant applications, and research
  management such as supervision and training of research fellows and other
  staff. The successful candidate will also teach and supervise, prepare
  and participate in examinations, and fulfill other department tasks as
  needed.
</p>

<p>
  The position is open from March&nbsp;1, 2023, or as soon as possible
  thereafter, though the exact starting date is negotiable.
</p>

<p>
  The working language of the Algorithms and Complexity Section is
  English, and knowledge of English is also fully sufficient to
  navigate every-day life in Denmark in general. It might also be
  worth mentioning that Denmark routinely scores at the absolute top
  in rankings of quality of life such as, e.g., the
  <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/">OECD Better Life Index</a>.
</p>



<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>
  <em>Needed qualifications at the Tenure-track Assistant Professor level:</em>

  The position requires an increasing publication trajectory in
  international premier venues in the area of specialization. Research
  plans and publication record should delineate a clear potential for
  attracting external funding. An active network of international
  collaborations will be considered as a positive asset. The tenure-track
  assistant professor must have an academic standing showing
  internationally competitive research, and have high potential to make a
  continued scientific impact at the international level. Documented
  university-level experience in delivering high-quality
  undergraduate/graduate teaching is not mandatory but will be an
  advantage. If not already holding formal pedagogical qualifications, the
  successful candidate is required to obtain pedagogical training
  equivalent to the University of Copenhagen Teaching and Learning in
  Higher Education program for Assistant Professors.
</p>


<p>
  <em>Needed qualifications at the Associate Professor level:</em>
  
  The position requires a track-record of publications in international
  premier venues in the area of specialization as well as proof of
  successfully attracted external research funding. Candidates are also
  required to have documented university-level competence in delivering
  high-quality undergraduate/graduate teaching and must be able to explain
  and reflect upon their teaching practice and portfolio. Formal
  pedagogical training or supervision equivalent to the University of
  Copenhagen teacher training program is expected. Candidates are also
  expected to have managerial qualifications, for instance in managing
  their own research group, and outreach experience.
</p>

<p>
  Assessment of applicants will primarily consider their level of
  documented, internationally competitive research. Documented teaching
  qualifications and ability to attract external funding will also be
  considered, as will managerial and outreach qualifications.
</p>


  
<h2>Workplace</h2>

<p>
  The
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>
  was founded in 1479 and is the oldest and largest university in
  Denmark. It is often ranked as the best university in Scandinavia and
  consistently as one of the top places in Europe. Within computer science,
  it is ranked 2nd in the European Union (post-Brexit) by ShanghaiRanking.
</p>

<p>
  The
  <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/">Department of Computer Science</a>
  offers a friendly and thriving international environment with excellent
  opportunities to build up an internationally competitive research
  group. There are many funding options for getting started on research in
  Denmark, and the department has an experienced research support unit that
  offers mentoring and assistance when applying for funding. Further
  information on start packages and recruitment grants offered by Danish
  private and public foundations is available at
  <a href="https://www.science.ku.dk/english/research/recruitment-grants-and-start-packages/experienced-researchers/">www.science.ku.dk/english/research/recruitment-grants-and-start-packages/experienced-researchers/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Copenhagen is one of the ten most livable cities in the world with a rich culture
  (<a href="https://www.visitcopenhagen.com">www.visitcopenhagen.com</a>).
  Family life is made easy by a publicly supported daycare and healthcare systems, dual career opportunities, parental leave, and six weeks of annual vacation. International candidates may find information on living and working in Denmark at
  <a href="https://www.workindenmark.dk">www.workindenmark.dk</a>.
  Useful information is also available at the International Staff Mobility office
  (<a href="https://ism.ku.dk">ism.ku.dk</a>),
  which offers a variety of services to international researchers coming to and working at the University of Copenhagen.
