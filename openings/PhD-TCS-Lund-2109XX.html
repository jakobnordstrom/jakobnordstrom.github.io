  The Department of Computer Science at
  Lund University
  invites  applications for
<!--  a -->
  <strong>
    <!-- postdoc positions -->
    one PhD position in
    theoretical computer science
  </strong>
  and
  <strong>

    one PhD position in combinatorial optimization.

</p><p>

  </p><h2>Job Description</h2>
  
<p>
  
  The
  <!-- postdoctoral researchers -->
  PhD students
  will be working in the
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group</a>
  headed by
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>,
  which is active at both Lund University and the University of
  Copenhagen on either side of the Öresund Bridge.

</p>
<p>
  The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems.

  This creates a special environment, where theoretical and applied
  research cross-fertilise each other, and where unexpected and
  exciting synergies often arise.
  
  Much of the  activities of the group revolve around powerful algorithmic
  paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving,
  Gr&ouml;bner basis computations, integer linear programming, and constraint
  programming. This leads to classical
  questions in computational complexity theory&mdash;though often with
  new, fascinating twists&mdash;but also involves work on devising
  clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in
  practice.
</p>

<p>
  We currently have one opening for a more theoretically oriented PhD student,
  funded by a Consolidator Grant from the 
  <a href="https://www.vr.se/english.html">Swedish Research Council</a>,
  and one more applied opening financed by  the
  <a href="http://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI,
    Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>.
  There is a lot of flexibility as to what kind of research the PhD
  students will pursue, though, since there are no sharp boundaries
  between different projects going on in the group.
</p>

<p>
  On the theory side, most of our work is in proof complexity, studies
  formal systems for reasoning about logic formulas and other types of
  problems.

  <!-- 
  On the theory side, most of our work is in proof complexity, i.e.,
  the study of formal systems for reasoning about logic formulas and
  other types of problems from the point of view of computational
  complexity.
 -->

  Proof complexity has connections to foundational questions in
  computational complexity theory, but also plays an important role in
  algorithm analysis by providing a rigorous understanding of the
  power and limitations of different algorithmic approaches.

  <!--
  Proof complexity has connections to foundational questions
  in computational complexity theory, but another important motivation
  is algorithm analysis. All algorithms use some kind of method of
  reasoning to compute solutions to problems, and proof complexity can
  be used to analyse the potential and limitations of such methods (and
  thereby of the algorithms using them).
  -->

  As often happens in theoretical
  computer science, our research has revealed deep,
  and often quite surprising, connections to other areas such as, e.g.,
  circuit complexity, communication complexity,
  and hardness of approximation,
  <!--  and finite model theory, -->
  <!-- and so we are also interested in such areas. -->
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
  and therefore researchers in these or other related areas are more
  than welcome to apply.
  -->
  <!-- PhD -->
  and so the research activities might well involve also such areas.
</p>

<p>
  On the practical side, we want to gain a more rigorous scientific
  understanding, and improve the performance, of modern algorithms for
  automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.

  We are particularly interested in designing algorithms that can
  exploit sophisticated mathematical techniques to achieve exponential
  improvements in performance compared to the current state of the
  art&mdash;something  that would seem to be possible in theory, but has
  so far been hard to achieve in practice.

  <!--
  We are particularly interested in harnessing powerful mathematical
  tools such as Gr&ouml;bner bases or 0-1 integer linear programming
  (also known as pseudo-Boolean solving) to achieve exponential
  improvements in performance, which seems possible in theory but has
  so far been hard to achieve in practice.

  Our most active line of work right now is focusing on combining
  ideas from pseudo-Boolean solving, MaxSAT solving, mixed integer
  linear programming (MIP), and constraint programming (CP) to
  construct new combinatorial solvers that have the potential to go
  significantly beyond the current state of the art.
  -->
</p>


<p>
  Quite recently, we have also made some breakthrough research on how to
  verify the correctness of state-of-the-art algorithms for
  combinatorial optimization. Such algorithms are often highly
  complex, and even mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes
  produce wrong results.

  Our goal is make state-of-the-art combinatorial solvers certifying,
  meaning that they output not only a solution but also a
  machine-verifiable proof that is easy to check and provides a 100%
  guarantee that the claimed solution is correct and
  complete.

  <!--
  Our goal is to redesign state-of-the-art combinatorial solvers to
  make them certifying, i.e., so that they output not only a solution
  but also a simple, machine-verifiable proof that the claimed
  solution is correct and complete—this is also known as proof
  logging.  Importantly, such machine-verifiable proofs should be very
  easy to generate and should require low overhead on the solver side,
  but should at the same time be very easy to check efficiently, and
  should provide 100% formal guarantees of correctness.

  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
      Within the overall framework sketched above, the postdocs will be
      expected and encouraged to contribute to and influence the research
      agenda. Taking part in teaching graduate seminar courses is
      encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and the
      group also receives visitors on a regular basis.

<p>
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!-- 
  These postdoc positions are full-time employed positions for one
  year with a possible (and expected) one-year extension. The expected
  starting date is September 2020, although this is to some extent
  negotiable.

  <!-- PhD -->

  <!--  This is a -->

  positions,
  but PhD positions
  usually (though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case
  they are prolonged for one more year.

  <!--
  The expected starting date is September 2021, although this is to
  some extent negotiable.
  -->
  
  The starting date is negotiable but should ideally be as early as
  possible during the autumn of 2021.

  All our positions are fully funded and come with a competitive salary.
