<h1>
  <!-- Postdoctoral Position/s -->
  PhD Position
  in
  Theoretical Computer Science
  and/or
  Combinatorial Optimization
</h1>

<p>
  The Department of Computer Science at
  Lund University
  invites  applications for
  a 
  <strong>
    <!-- postdoc positions -->
    PhD position in
    theoretical computer science
    and/or
    combinatorial optimization.
  </strong>

</p>

<h2>Job Description</h2>
  
<p>  
  The
  <!-- postdoctoral researcher/s -->
  PhD student
  will be working in the
  <a href="https://www.jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group</a>
  headed by
  <a href="https://www.jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>,
  which is active at both Lund University and the University of
  Copenhagen on either side of the Öresund Bridge.
</p>

<p>
  The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment,
  where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different
  theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of
  research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting
  synergies often arise.

  Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful
  algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
  solving, Gr&ouml;bner basis computations, integer linear
  programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical
  questions in computational complexity theory&mdash;though often with
  new, fascinating twists&mdash;but also involves work on devising
  clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in
  practice.
</p>


<p>
  Our most recent new line of research is on how to verify the
  correctness of state-of-the-art algorithms for combinatorial
  optimization. Such algorithms are often highly complex, and even
  mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes produce wrong
  results. Our work on designing a new generation of certifying
  combinatorial solvers, which output not only a answer but also a
  machine-verifiable mathematical proof that this answer is correct,
  has already received several international awards, 
  but many more exciting problems are still waiting to be solved!
</p>

<p>
  With this call, we are mainly looking for a mathematically gifted
  PhD student with excellent programming skills to continue our
  ground-breaking work on certifying algorithms, funded by the
  <a href="http://wasp-sweden.org/">Wallenberg AI,
    Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)</a>.
  There is some flexibility as to what kind of research PhD students
  in the group pursue, though, and all candidates are welcome, both
  those who want to go deep into either theory or practice and those
  who are inspired by the challenge of bridging the gap between the
  two.

  Please see
  <a href="../miao-group/index.html#about">the description of the MIAO group</a>
  to learn more about our work.
</p>

<!--
<p>
  On the theory side, most of our work is in proof complexity, which studies
  formal systems for reasoning about logic formulas and other types of
  problems.

  Proof complexity has connections to foundational questions in
  computational complexity theory, but also plays an important role in
  algorithm analysis by providing a rigorous understanding of the
  power and limitations of different algorithmic approaches.

  As often happens in theoretical
  computer science, our research has revealed deep,
  and often quite surprising, connections to other areas such as, e.g.,
  circuit complexity, communication complexity,
  and hardness of approximation,
-->
  <!-- and so we are also interested in such areas. -->
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
  and therefore researchers in these or other related areas are more
  than welcome to apply.
  -->
  <!-- PhD -->
<!--
  and so the research activities might well involve also such areas.
</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
  On the practical side, we want to gain a more rigorous scientific
  understanding, and improve the performance, of modern algorithms for
  automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.

  We are particularly interested in designing algorithms that can
  exploit sophisticated mathematical techniques to achieve exponential
  improvements in performance compared to the current state of the
  art&mdash;something that theoretical research suggests should be
  possible, but that has so far been hard to achieve in practice.
</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
  Quite recently, we have also made some breakthrough research on how to
  verify the correctness of state-of-the-art algorithms for
  combinatorial optimization. Such algorithms are often highly
  complex, and even mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes
  produce wrong results.

  Our goal is to design a new generation of <em>certifying</em>
  combinatorial solvers with so-called <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the solvers output not only a answer but also a
  machine-verifiable proof that is easy to check and provides 100%
  formal guarantees that the claimed answer is correct.
</p>
-->

<p></p>
<p>

  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
      Within the overall framework sketched above, the postdocs will be
      expected and encouraged to contribute to and influence the research
      agenda. Taking part in teaching graduate seminar courses is
      encouraged but not required. Travel funding is included, and the
      group also receives visitors on a regular basis.
    -->
  
</p>
<p>
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!-- 
  These postdoc positions are full-time employed positions for one
  year with a possible (and expected) one-year extension. The expected
  starting date is September 2020, although this is to some extent
  negotiable.
    -->
</p>

<p>
  <!-- PhD -->
  Our PhD positions are four-year full-time employed positions, but they
  usually (though not necessarily) include 20% teaching, in which case
  they are prolonged for one more year.

  <!--
  The expected starting date is September 2021, although this is to
  some extent negotiable.
  -->
  
  The starting date is negotiable, but should ideally be
  during the autumn of 2023 or in early 2024.
  
  All positions in the research group are fully funded, employed
  positions (including travel money) that come with an internationally
  competitive salary.
</p>
