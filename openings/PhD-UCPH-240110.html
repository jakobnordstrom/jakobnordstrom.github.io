<h2>The Scientific Environment</h2>

<!-- MIAO text -->
<!--
<p>
  The PhD students will be working in the

  We are looking for outstanding junior researchers with an innovative
  mind-set and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and complement the
  research profile of the

  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Mathematical Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO) group</a>
  headed by
  <a href="http://www.jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>,
  which is active at both the University of Copenhagen and Lund
  University on either side of the &Oslash;resund Bridge.
</p>


<p>
  The MIAO research group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems. This creates a very special environment,
  where we do not only conduct in-depth research on different
  theoretical and applied topics, but where different lines of
  research cross-fertilise each other and unexpected and exciting
  synergies often arise.


  Much of the activities of the group revolve around powerful
  algorithmic paradigms such as, e.g., Boolean satisfiability (SAT)
  solving, Gr&ouml;bner basis computations, integer linear
  programming, and constraint programming. This leads to classical
  questions in computational complexity theory&mdash;though often with
  new, fascinating twists&mdash;but also involves work on devising
  clever algorithms that can exploit the power of such paradigms in
  practice.
</p>


<p>
  We are fortunate to be part of the Algorithms and Complexity Section
  at DIKU, which is world-leading in algorithms and complexity theory
  (currently ranked 6th worldwide by
  <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?act&world">CSrankings.org</a>).
  DIKU hosts the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>
  joint with the IT University of Copenhagen,
  and we also have extensive collaborations with the Technical
  University of Denmark (DTU) and with Lund University on the Swedish
  side of the &Oslash;resund Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We
  aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious,
  creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of
  mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in
  algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational
  research, we do have a track record of surprising algorithmic
  discoveries leading to major industrial applications.

<!-- MORE DETAILED TEXTS FOR PHD ANNOUNCEMENTS DESCRIBING THE RESEARCH TOPICS -->

<!--
<p>
  We currently have openings for both
  theoretically and practically inclined PhD students.
  There is a lot of flexibility as to what kind of research the PhD
  students will pursue, and all candidates are welcome, both
  those who want to go deep into either theory or practice and those who are
  inspired by the challenge of bridging the gap between the two.  

<p>
  On the theory side, most of our work is in proof complexity, which studies
  formal systems for reasoning about logic formulas and other types of
  problems.

  Proof complexity has connections to foundational questions in
  computational complexity theory, but also plays an important role in
  algorithm analysis by providing a rigorous understanding of the
  power and limitations of different algorithmic approaches.

  As often happens in theoretical
  computer science, our research has revealed deep,
  and often quite surprising, connections to other areas such as, e.g.,
  circuit complexity, communication complexity,
  and hardness of approximation,
  
  -->
  
  <!-- and so we are also interested in such areas. -->
  <!-- POSTDOC -->
  <!--
  and therefore researchers in these or other related areas are more
  than welcome to apply.
  -->
  <!-- PhD -->

  <!--
  and so the research activities might well involve also such areas.

</p>
-->

<!--
<p>
  On the practical side, we want to gain a more rigorous scientific
  understanding, and improve the performance, of modern algorithms for
  automated reasoning and combinatorial optimization.

  We are particularly interested in designing algorithms that can
  exploit sophisticated mathematical techniques to achieve exponential
  improvements in performance compared to the current state of the
  art&mdash;something that theoretical research suggests should be
  possible, but that has so far been hard to achieve in practice.
</p>

<p>
  Quite recently, we have also made some breakthrough research on how to
  verify the correctness of state-of-the-art algorithms for
  combinatorial optimization. Such algorithms are often highly
  complex, and even mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes
  produce wrong results.

  Our goal is to design a new generation of <em>certifying</em>
  combinatorial solvers with so-called <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the solvers output not only a solution but also a
  machine-verifiable proof that is easy to check and provides 100%
  formal guarantees that the claimed solution is correct and
  complete.
