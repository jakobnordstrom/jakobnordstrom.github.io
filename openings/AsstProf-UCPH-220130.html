  Tenure-Track Assistant Professorship in Computational Complexity Theory   
</h1>

<p>
  The Department of Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen
  invites  applications for a
  <strong>
    tenure-track assistant professorship in computational complexity theory.
  </strong>
</p>

<h2>The Scientific Environment</h2>
  
<p>
  We are looking for an outstanding junior researcher with an
  innovative mind-set and intellectual curiosity to strengthen and
  complement the research profile of the
  <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/ac/">Algorithms and Complexity Section</a>
  at DIKU.
  This is a world-leading research environment
  (currently ranked 6th worldwide in algorithms and complexity by
  <a href="http://csrankings.org/#/index?act&world">CSrankings.org</a>),
  with a strong presence at top-tier conferences like STOC, FOCS, CCC,
  and SODA, and also with publications in premier AI conferences like
  AAAI, IJCAI, and NeurIPS. We are home to the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>,
  joint with the IT University of Copenhagen, and have extensive
  collaborations with the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) and
  with Lund University on the Swedish side of the &Oslash;resund
  Bridge, as well as with our many visitors. We aim to attract top
  talent from around the world to an ambitious, creative,
  collaborative, and fun environment.

  Using the power of mathematics, we strive to create fundamental
  breakthroughs in algorithms and complexity theory.

  While the focus in on foundational research, we do have a track
  record of surprising algorithmic discoveries leading to major
  industrial applications.
</p>


<h2>Job Description</h2>

<p>
  The tenure track assistant professor must have an academic standing
  showing internationally competitive research, and/or have
  internationally recognized high potential to make a future impact.

  The duties of the tenure-track assistant professor will primarily
  consist of research, including obligations with regard to
  publication/scientific communication and research-based teaching
  with associated examination obligations within theoretical computer
  science. To a limited extent the position may also include other
  duties.
</p>



<p>
  The position is open from September&nbsp;1, 2021, or as soon as
  possible thereafter, though the exact starting date is negotiable.
</p>

<p>
  The working language of the Algorithms and Complexity Section is
  English, and knowledge of English is also fully sufficient to
  navigate every-day life in Denmark in general. It might also be
  worth mentioning that Denmark routinely scores at the absolute top
  in rankings of quality of life such as, e.g., the
  <a href="http://www.oecdbetterlifeindex.org/">OECD Better Life Index</a>.
</p>



<h2>Qualifications</h2>

<p>
  The successful candidate should have:
  <ul>
    <li>
      A PhD degree in computer science, mathematics, or equivalent.
    <li>
      Demonstrated strength within computational complexity theory with
      a solid publication record in leading conferences such as STOC,
      FOCS, SODA, CCC, and ICALP, and/or in journals such as JACM and
      SICOMP. Interdisciplinary work applying complexity theory to other
    areas is viewed as an additional asset but is not necessary.
  </ul>
</p>


<p>
  Assessment of applicants will primarily consider their level of
  documented, internationally competitive research. The ability to
  attract external funding will be considered together with outreach
  qualifications. Teaching qualifications are not mandatory but
  documented teaching qualifications and teaching experience will be
  considered.
</p>

<h2>Workplace</h2>

<p>

  The University of Copenhagen was founded in 1479 and is the oldest
  and largest university in Denmark. It is often ranked as the best
  university in Scandinavia and consistently as one of the top places
  in Europe. Within computer science, it is ranked 2nd in the European
  Union (post-Brexit) by ShanghaiRanking.
</p>

<p>
  The department offers a friendly and thriving international research
  and working environment with opportunities to build up
  internationally competitive research groups. Working conditions at
  the University of Copenhagen support a healthy work-life balance and
  Copenhagen is a family-friendly capital city.
</p>
