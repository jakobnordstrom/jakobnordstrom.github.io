  <!--
      Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving is one of the most impressive
      success stories in all of computer science.
    -->
  
  The Boolean satisfiability (SAT) problem is one of the most
  fascinating problems in computer science and mathematics. Though it is deceptively
  easy to state&mdash;given a formula in propositional logic, is it
  possible to assign variables true and false so that the formula
  evaluates to true?&mdash;it has been the focus of extensive research
  ever since the dawn of computer science.

  SAT was the first problem to be proven <em>NP</em>-complete
  in the early 1970s, and a
  widely accepted hypothesis is that it requires exponential time to
  solve in the worst case.  Yet since the turn of the millennium
  there have been dramatic performance improvements of SAT solvers
  based on <em>conflict-driven clause learning (CDCL)</em>, and today
  CDCL solvers are routinely used to solve large-scale real-world
  problems in, e.g., hardware and software verification, AI planning,
  automated theorem proving, and many other areas.

  This success has also led to exports of the conflict-driven paradigm
  beyond SAT solving to different types of optimization problems.
</p>

<p>
  A drawback with CDCL is that from a mathematical point of view the
  method of reasoning is quite weak&mdash;it is based on
  the <em>resolution</em> proof system,
  for which exponential lower bounds are known even for simple combinatorial
  principles.
  Another issue is that the problems to be solved have to be encoded in
  <em>conjunctive normal form (CNF)</em> as a collection of disjunctive clauses,
  which leads to a loss in information compared to higher-level constraints and
  negatively affects the reasoning power.
  <!--
      This can be addressed by using preprocessing techniques for, e.g.,
      Gaussian elimination and cardinality reasoning, but these techniques
      work only in limited cases and are again quite sensitive to the
      exact encoding of the problem.
    -->
</p>

<p>
  An attractive option is to instead use (linear)
  <em>pseudo-Boolean (PB) constraints</em>, i.e.,
  0-1 integer linear inequalities.
  Such constraints provide a succinct way of encoding a wide variety of computational tasks, 
  including problems with an objective function to
  be optimized.  Pseudo-Boolean constraints are more expressive than CNF,
  but are close enough that CNF-based techniques can be harnessed to
  attack pseudo-Boolean problems. The connection to integer linear
  programming (ILP) makes it natural to also borrow insights from
  this area. 
  
  Some pseudo-Boolean solvers are still based on resolution, in that
  an important part of the solving process is to translate the input
  to CNF and use the CDCL algorithm. Another
  approach, however, is to go beyond resolution and build solvers using the
  <em>cutting planes</em> proof system, which is known to be
  exponentially stronger than resolution in theory.

  Although harnessing this increased power algorithmically is a far
  from trivial task, there have been notable successes with solvers
  such as
  <a href="https://www.sat4j.org/"><em>Sat4j</em></a>
  developed  by
  <a href="https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/~leberre/">Daniel Le Berre</a>'s
  group at Université d'Artois
  and 
  <a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/roundingsat"><em>RoundingSat</em></a>
  from the
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
      Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  group in Copenhagen/Lund,
  as well as other tools developed on top of these solvers.
</p>


<h2>
  <a name="purpose"></a>
  Purpose of This Workshop
</h2>

<p>
  To highlight and celebrate these developments, we are organizing an
  informal workshop for people working on pseudo-Boolean solving and
  optimization and related problems. The idea is to meet for a few days
  to hear technical presentations of recent and ongoing
  research and also discuss the potential for collaboration on
  research and/or solver development in different directions.

  The workshop will focus on pseudo-Boolean solvers and techniques
  that operate natively on 0-1 integer linear inequalities, rather
  than with CNF encodings of such inequalities. However,
  pseudo-Boolean techniques have recently come up also in contexts
  such as mixed integer linear programming (MIP) and constraint
  programming (CP), and CNF encodings can also be of interest even for
  native pseudo-Boolean solvers, so the focus described above is
  intended to be inclusive rather than exclusive.
</p>

<p>
  Possible interesting topics for discussion could include, but would
  not be limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> pseudo-Boolean conflict analysis and propagation,
  <li> optimization techniques on top of pseudo-Boolean decision oracles (inspired by MaxSAT and other areas),
  <li> proof logging techniques to make pseudo-Boolean solvers certifying,
  <li> integration of techniques from MIP and CP,
  <li> exports of techniques to MIP and CP.
</ul>

<p>
  Clearly, the most important aspect of any endeavour like this is to
  choose a suitable name for the event. It has been proposed that a title like
  <em>Workshop on Solving Linear Optimization Problems for
  Pseudo-Booleans and Yonder</em>, which obviously abbreviates
  to <em>SLOPPY</em>, would convey well the goal of carefully designing highly
  efficient but logically sound combinatorial solvers that can ideally use proof
  logging to generate provably correct results.

  <a name="alexander-tesch">Alexander Tesch (BoolAI):</a>
  A MIP Perspective on Pseudo-Boolean Optimization
</h3>

<p>
  In this talk, we address pseudo-Boolean optimization through the lense
  of Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP). In particular, we will present an
  alternative approach to PB conflict analysis which performs sequential
  lifting of the underlying knapsack polytopes of the reason and
  conflict constraints. We will give a first theoretical and practical
  comparison between our approach and a few more common approaches from
  the PB literature such as MIR cuts and (partial-) weakening. In the
  end, we also give an outlook on more advanced cut-generation
  techniques from the MIP literature that could be applied to PB
  conflict analysis and core-guided search.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="jeremias-berg">Jeremias Berg (University of Helsinki):</a>
  Oracle-Based Local Search for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization
</h3>

<p>
  Oracle-based local search is a recently proposed approach to anytime
  constraint optimization that aims to find good, though not provably,
  optimal solutions quickly. The approach can be seen as a type of
  stochastic local search in which a decision oracle for the underlying
  constraint language is used to move from solution to solution. Using
  highly effective CDCL SAT solvers as oracles, oracle-based local
  search has been highly successful in anytime maximum satisfiability
  (MaxSAT). Solvers implementing the approach regularly top the results
  of recent MaxSAT evaluations.
</p>

<p>
  In this talk, I will outline our recent (published at ECAI 23) work
  in extending oracle-based Local Search to the more general paradigm
  of pseudo-Boolean optimization (PBO). As a basis for the approach,
  we use recent advances in practical approaches to checking the
  satisfiability of pseudo-Boolean constraints. We outline various
  heuristics within the oracle-based approach to anytime PBO solving
  and show that the approach compares in practice favorably and
  orthogonally, both to a recently proposed local search approach for
  PBO that is in comparison to a more traditional instantiation of the
  stochastic local search paradigm and a recent exact PBO approach
  used as an anytime solver.

<h3>
  <a name="jordi-coll">Jordi Coll (Universitat de Girona):</a>
  Branch-and-Bound MaxSAT Solving with <em>MaxCDCL</em>
</h3>

<p>
  MaxSAT is a widely studied NP-hard optimization problem due to its
  broad utility in modeling and solving diverse optimization problems of
  practical interest. Branch-and-Bound (BnB) MaxSAT solvers had shown to
  be an efficient approach to solving random and crafted instances, but
  had traditionally failed to be as competitive as SAT-based MaxSAT
  solvers when dealing with instances of industrial nature. However,
  this has changed recently with the introduction of the <em>MaxCDCL</em>
  algorithm, which effectively integrates clause learning into BnB to
  solve MaxSAT. In this talk we provide a detailed description of the
  <em>MaxCDCL</em> algorithm, deepen in relevant implementation details and show
  how this approach relates to and differs from other approaches to
  MaxSAT. We will place special emphasis on the lookahead procedure to
  compute a lower bound of the cost of a partial assignment&mdash;which is
  the core and distinguishing part of <em>MaxCDCL</em>&mdash;and its integration with
  a CDCL-based solver.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="pierre-montalbano">Pierre Montalbano (Université de Tours):</a>
  A Conflict-Free Learning Approach for MILP and WCSP Optimisation
</h3>

<p>
  Weighted Constraint Satisfaction Problems (WCSP) are an extension of
  the classic Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), where costs (or
  weights) are associated with constraint violations. The objective is
  to find an assignment that minimizes the total constraint
  violation. Solving WCSPs typically relies on backtracking search and
  constraint propagation to compute lower bounds. It has the ability
  to handle global constraints, but it often requires a dedicated
  algorithm to propagate them.
</p>

<p>
  Guided by the success of conflict-based learning methods in multiple
  domains (such as SAT, Pseudo-Boolean Optimization, or ILP), we
  designed a new conflict-free learning mechanism. This mechanism aims
  to memorize, through a linear constraint, the lower bounds of
  encountered sub-problems. If the same sub-problem (or a similar one)
  reappears in the search, propagating the previously learned
  constraint will help to obtain a stronger lower bound. This learning
  mechanism is conflict-free, meaning that it doesn't require a
  conflict to be triggered and can be used to learn a constraint at
  every node of a search tree.
</p>

<p>
  Our approach integrates techniques from CP, ILP, and PBO, and we
  show how it can be embedded inside a classic MILP solver before
  extending it to WCSP solvers. We implemented this learning mechanism
  in a simple solver performing branch-and-bound and using CPLEX to
  solve the LP at every node. We show that it can significantly
  decrease the number of visited nodes for the knapsack problem or
  kb-tree (instances with a bounded treewidth).
</p>
 

<h3>
  <a name="rui-zhao">Rui Zhao (Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya):</a>
  Faster Unit Propagation in Pseudo-Boolean Solving
</h3>

<p>
  Unit propagation is known to be one of the most time-consuming
  procedures inside CDCL-based SAT solvers. Not surprisingly, it has
  been studied in depth and the two-watched-literal scheme, enhanced
  with implementation details boosting its performance, has emerged as
  the dominant method. In pseudo-Boolean solvers, the importance of
  unit propagation is similar, but no dominant method exists: counter
  propagation and watched-based extensions are efficient for different
  types of constraints, which has opened the door to hybrid
  methods. However, probably due to the higher complexity of
  implementing pseudo-Boolean solvers, research efforts have not
  focused much on concrete implementation details for unit propagation
  but rather on higher-level aspects of other procedures, such as
  conflict analysis. In this talk, we will present (i) a novel
  methodology to precisely assess the performance of propagation
  mechanisms, (ii) an evaluation of implementation variants of the
  propagation methods present in <em>RoundingSat</em> and (iii) a detailed
  analysis showing that hybrid methods outperform the ones based on a
  single technique. Our final conclusion will be that a carefully
  implemented hybrid propagation method is considerably faster than
  the preferred propagation mechanism in <em>RoundingSat</em>, and that this
  improvement leads to a better overall performance of the solver.

  <a name="dieter-vandesande">Dieter Vandesande (Vrije Universiteit Brussel):</a>
  Proof Logging for Branch-and-Bound MaxSAT with <em>MaxCDCL</em>
</h3>

<p>
  In earlier work, MaxSAT solvers implementing both solution-improving
  as well as core-guided search have been made certifying using the
  <em>VeriPB</em> proof system. In this talk, I will show the recent
  developments and ongoing work on proof logging a solver implementing
  a third solving paradigm: Branch-and-Bound search. More
  specifically, we will cover the solver <em>MaxCDCL</em>, which combines
  Branch-and-Bound search with the power of clause learning as it is
  implemented in SAT solvers.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="marc-vinyals">Marc Vinyals (University of Auckland):</a>
  Proof Logging for <em>RoundingSat</em>
</h3>

<p>
  We discuss how proof logging is implemented in RoundingSAT. While
  pseudo-Boolean conflict analysis can be logged using standard
  cutting planes rules, and this still applies to linear search
  optimisation, logging core-guided optimisation requires a more
  careful implementation. In particular, we discuss how to log lazy
  reified variables, objective reformulation, and hardening.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="daniel-le-berre">Daniel Le Berre (Université d'Artois):</a>
  Wishes for the <em>VeriPB</em> proof format
</h3>

<p>
  Two proofs logging have been added to <em>Sat4j</em> in 2024: <em>IDRUP</em> and
  <em>VeriPB</em> 2.0. The two proof formats had the common feature to
  encompass several calls to the SAT solver, contrariwise to UNSAT
  proofs certificates in <em>DRUP</em> or <em>VeriPB</em> 1.0: it required some small
  changes in <em>Sat4j</em>. When <em>Sat4j</em> was submitted to the PB evaluation, it
  happened that many simplifications and normalisations performed in
  <em>Sat4j</em> required a <em>VeriPB</em> justifications when using the cutting planes
  proof system but not the resolution based one. This prevented <em>Sat4j</em>
  CP to participate to the certified tracks. The presentation will
  present some lessons learned when adding those proof formats in
  <em>Sat4j</em> and will focus on potential improvements in <em>VeriPB</em> to simplify
  its adoption by solvers designers.

  superfancy but might be cheaper than hotel options. If you are
  interested in inquiring whether it is possible to book a room at the
  guest house, then please send a message to 
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>
  well ahead of time to get connected to Lund University administration.
</p>

<p>
  There should also be a generous selection of hotels in Lund available at your favourite travel booking site.
  Lund is a half-hour train ride away from
  Copenhagen Airport and one hour away from central Copenhagen, where
  hotels are likely to be markedly more expensive than
  on the Swedish side of the Öresund Bridge.
</p>

<h3>Directions to Lund</h3>

<p>
  If you are travelling by air, the
  <a href="https://www.cph.dk/en">Copenhagen Airport Kastrup (CPH)</a>
  is probably the most convenient option, although
  <a href="https://www.swedavia.com/malmo/">Malmö Airport (MMX)</a>
  in Sturup might also be an alternative. From Copenhagen Airport you
  take the train to Lund. From Malmö Airport there are
  <a href="https://www.flygbussarna.se/en/malmo">airport buses</a>
  to Malmö, and then you take a 10-minute train ride onwards to
  Lund. Below follow directions to Lund from Copenhagen.
</p>

<p>
  To get to the CS department at Lund University from Copenhagen Airport, take the
  <a href="https://www.oresundstag.se/en">Öresund commuter train</a>
  across the Öresund Bridge to Lund. <em>Please do
  not forget to bring your passport along, as you will be crossing the
  border between Sweden and Denmark and there are sometimes passport
  controls.</em> All commuter trains from Copenhagen to any destination in
  Sweden will pass through Lund ca 10 minutes after Malmö Central
  Station.
</p>

<p>
  The easiest way of buying tickets to Sweden might be to download the
  <a href="https://www.skanetrafiken.se/appen/">Skånetrafiken app</a>.
  You can adjust the settings so that you get e-mailed receipts for all purchases.
  There are also ticket machines at Copenhagen Airport.  
</p>

<p>
  The most convenient route onwards from Lund Central Station
  would seem to be to 
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ypA4rLJLSSWHAfLR8">take the tram to the "Lund LTH" stop</a>,
  which takes just a few minutes, and then walk from there a few
  minutes minutes more.
  If you are coming with the standard Öresund commuter train from
  Copenhagen, then the local public transport in Lund is included in
  your train ticket.
</p>

<p>
  To reach the tram stop, take the stairs at the middle exit of the
  platform at Lund Central Station (usually at the front of the train
  in the direction of travel if you are coming from Copenhagen/Malmö,
  or close to the first train cars), take a right, and then walk
  straight out of the train station and cross one small and one
  slightly larger street. Now you should see a bus stop to your left,
  and some 20-30 meters behind that bus stop there is a tram station.
</p>

<p>
  After getting off the tram at the "Lund LTH" stop, walk right to
  John Ericssons väg and continue straight, then take a right before
  you reach the Vattenhallen Science Center to reach the main entrance
  at Klas Anshelms väg 10. To get to the MIAO research group, bear
  right after you have entered the building and walk up the stairs one
  floor up, take a left turn and then immediately a right turn &mdash; you
  should now be in front of a locked door with a sign "Datavetenskap"
  (i.e., Computer Science). If anyone is there and
  opens for you, then just continue straight past a few doors until you see
  offices with the MIAO logo.

<h2><a name="about-miao"></a>About the MIAO Research Group</h2>

<p>  
  The
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
    Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group is based on both sides of the Öresund Bridge at the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>.

  The  group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems.
  
  This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct
  in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but
  where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and
  unexpected and exciting synergies often arise.
</p>

<p>
  We are closely affiliated with the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>,
  and are part of a world-leading environment in algorithms and
  complexity theory encompassing also the
  <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.

  We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious,
  creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of
  mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in
  algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational
  research, algorithms and complexity researchers in Copenhagen
  have a track record of surprising algorithmic
  discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
</p>

**********

<p>
  In the last few years we have also made
  research breakthroughs on how to verify the correctness of
  state-of-the-art algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization.  Such algorithms are often highly complex, and even
  mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes produce wrong
  results.

  Our goal is to usher in a new generation of <em>certifying</em>
  combinatorial solvers with so-called <em>proof logging</em>, meaning
  that the solvers output
  not only a result but also a simple, machine-verifiable
  proof that the claimed result is correct.
  For such a certifying solver, the workflow becomes as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Run the solver on a problem instance to obtain not only a
    computed result, but also a proof of correctness.
  </li><li>
    Feed the problem, the result, and the proof of correctness to a special,
    dedicated <em>proof checker</em> for verification.
  </li><li>
    Accept the result if the proof checker says that the proof is valid.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Importantly, these machine-verifiable proofs should be very easy to
  generate and should require low overhead on the solver side, but
  should also be very easy to check efficiently on the proof checker
  side, and should still provide 100% formal guarantees of
  correctness.

  This might sound just a little bit too good to be true, but the tool
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  that we have developed can now provide efficient proof logging for
  several combinatorial solving paradigms that have previously been beyond reach,
  and we have recently received several prestigious awards for our work.
