    <a href="openings/PhD-Lund-230925.html">I am looking for a PhD student</a>
    who will help us go even further beyond the state of the art in
    combinatorial solving (as explained in
    <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/talks/pseudo-boolean-solving-optimization">this Simons Institute tutorial</a>)
    and/or provably correct computation (as per this
    <a href="https://youtu.be/s_5BIi4I22w">YouTube tutorial</a>).
    This is a pretty unique opportunity if you have a 
    strong background in both mathematics and programming and wish to combine the two. 
    
    The <strong>application deadline</strong> is
    <strong>September 25, 2023.</strong>

    The SAT solver with
    <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
    proof logging, <em>BreakID-kissat-low</em>,
    that we submitted to the
    <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2023/">SAT Competition 2023</a>
    was the most successful solver in the competition, and would have won 1st prize
    with last year's competition rules.
    
    With <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging we can support advanced SAT
    solving techniques that have previously been out of reach for the
    standard SAT proof logging format, thus increasing the power of the
    solver exponentially.  However, our proof checking is still not as
    fast as in the highly optimized checkers for the standard format
    that have been used for the last decade, and some of our proofs
    were not verified within the required time limits.

    Therefore, we instead had to to content ourselves with receiving
    an honorary 1st prize.
    
    We know how to make our toolchain for formal verification of
    proofs more efficient, though, and are working on it for next
    year&mdash;and it is already clear what is the future of efficient,
    powerful, fully general SAT proof logging&hellip;

    Our pseudo-Boolean proof checker

    in the

  About my research
</h2>

<p>
  Computers are everywhere today&mdash;at work, in our cars, in our
  living rooms, and even in our pockets&mdash;and have changed the world
  beyond our wildest imagination. Yet these marvellous devices are, at
  the core, amazingly simple and stupid: all they can do is to
  mechanically shuffle around zeros and ones. What is the true
  potential of such automated computational devices? And what are the
  limits of what can be done by mindless calculations? Understanding
  this kind of questions is ultimately what my research is about.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Computational complexity theory</em> gives these deep
  and fascinating philosophical questions a crisp mathematical
  meaning. A computational problem is any task that is in principle
  amenable to being solved by a computer&mdash;i.e., it can be solved
  by mechanical application of mathematical steps. By constructing
  general, abstract models of computers we can study how to design
  efficient methods, or <em>algorithms</em>, for solving different tasks, but
  also prove mathematical theorems showing that some computational
  problems just cannot be solved efficiently for inherent reasons.
</p>

<p>
  I am particularly interested in understanding <em>combinatorial
  optimization problems</em>, which are of fundamental mathematical
  importance but also have wide-ranging applications in industry. My
  goal is, one the one hand, to prove formally that many such problems
  are beyond the reach of current algorithmic techniques, but also, on
  the other hand, to develop new algorithms that have the potential to
  go significantly beyond the current state of the art.
  
  Recently, I have also been doing research on how complexity theory
  can be harnessed to produce certificates that algorithms are
  actually computing correct results. It is an open secret in
  combinatorial optimization that even the best commercial tools
  sometimes produce wrong answers, but there has been no really
  principled way of addressing this problem.
  We are working on changing this.
