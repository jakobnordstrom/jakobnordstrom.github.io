    which was arranged under the aegis of the

    in August 2024.

    During the week November 4-8, 2024, I am arranging the
    <a href="SLOPPY24/"><em>1st International Workshop on
	Solving Linear Optimization Problems for Pseudo-Booleans and Yonder
	(SLOPPY&nbsp;'24)</em></a>
    at Lund University.

  <li>
    Great news from the
    <a href="http://satisfiability.org/SAT24/">International Conference on
      Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing</a>
    in August 2024!
    <ol>
      
      <li>
	For the second year,
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB"><em>VeriPB</em></a>
	was used as one of the proof checkers in the
	<a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2024/">SAT Competition</a>,
	allowing solvers to use the full range of advanced solving techniques.
	We showed that just taking a previously existing SAT solver and doing nothing more
	than adding this proof logging support was enough to get a silver medal in the competition.
	
      <li>
	<em>VeriPB</em>
	was also used in the
	<a href="https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB24/">Pseudo-Boolean Competition</a>,
	where our solver
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/roundingsat"><em>RoundingSat</em></a>
	was one of the contestants.
	In the optimization track, 9&nbsp;out of the 12&nbsp;best solvers were based on the <em>RoundingSat</em> code base,
	and the original <em>RoundingSat</em> solver was the best one for both decision and optimization problems
	when certificates of correctness were required.
	
      <li>
	Former MIAO group PhD student Stephan Gocht was a runner-up for the  
	<em>SAT Association Fahiem Bacchus PhD Award in Satisfiability</em>.
	
      <li>
	And as another sign of the impact of our research, the SAT best paper was dedicated to a theoretical analysis
	of the proof system developed for <em>VeriPB</em>,
	while the best student paper investigated ways of improving <em>RoundingSat</em>.
    </ol>
	
  <li>
    In May 2024 I arranged the
    <a href="WHOOPS24/"><em>1st International Workshop on Highlights

    At
    the constraint programming conference

    student <a href="https://stephangocht.github.io/">Stephan Gocht</a>
    received the <em>ACP Doctoral Research Award</em>
    from the Association for Constraint Programming for his work on
    proof logging. Not only that, but our close
    collaborator <a href="https://ciaranm.github.io/">Ciaran McCreesh</a>
    received the <em>ACP Early Career Researcher Award</em>,
    among other things for our joint work on proof logging, and Ciaran and
    his PhD student <a href="https://matthewmcilree.com/">Matthew McIlree</a>
    got the <em>CP 2023 best paper award</em> for their work

    The SAT solver with
    <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
    proof logging, <em>BreakID-kissat-low</em>,
    that we submitted to the
    <a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2023/">SAT Competition 2023</a>
    was the most successful solver in the competition, and would have won 1st prize
    had the competition rules been like in previous years.
    
    With <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging we can support advanced SAT
    solving techniques that have previously been out of reach for the
    standard SAT proof logging format, thus increasing the power of the
    solver exponentially.  However, our proof checking is still not as
    fast as in the highly optimized checkers for the standard format
    that have been used for the last decade, and some of our proofs
    were not verified within the required time limits.

    Therefore, we instead had to to content ourselves with receiving
    an honorary 1st prize.
    
    We know how to make our toolchain for formal verification of
    proofs more efficient, though, and are working on it for next
    year&mdash;and it is already clear what is the future of efficient,
    powerful, fully general SAT proof logging&hellip;

  About my research
</h2>

<p>
  Computers are everywhere today&mdash;at work, in our cars, in our
  living rooms, and even in our pockets&mdash;and have changed the world
  beyond our wildest imagination. Yet these marvellous devices are, at
  the core, amazingly simple and stupid: all they can do is to
  mechanically shuffle around zeros and ones. What is the true
  potential of such automated computational devices? And what are the
  limits of what can be done by mindless calculations? Finding answers to
  this kind of questions is ultimately what my research is about.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Computational complexity theory</em> gives these deep
  and fascinating philosophical questions a crisp mathematical
  meaning. A computational problem is any task that is in principle
  amenable to being solved by a computer&mdash;i.e., it can be worked out
  by mechanical application of mathematical steps. By constructing
  general, abstract models of computers we can study how to design
  efficient methods, or <em>algorithms</em>, for solving different tasks, but
  also prove mathematical theorems showing that some computational
  problems just cannot be solved efficiently for inherent reasons
  (meaning that is impossible to design algorithms for them that are as efficient as we would like).
</p>

<p>
  I am particularly interested in understanding <em>combinatorial
  optimization problems</em>, which are of fundamental mathematical
  importance but also have wide-ranging applications in industry. My
  goal is, one the one hand, to prove formally that many such problems
  are beyond the reach of current algorithmic techniques, but also, on
  the other hand, to develop new algorithms that have the potential to
  go significantly beyond the current state of the art.
  
  Recently, I have also been doing research on how complexity theory
  can be harnessed to produce certificates that algorithms are
  actually computing correct results. It is an open secret in
  combinatorial optimization that even the best commercial tools
  sometimes produce wrong answers, but there has been no really
  principled way of addressing this problem.
  We are working on changing this.
