    Our pseudo-Boolean solver 
    <a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/roundingsat"><em>RoundingSat</em></a>

    and was even in the top-10 in the non-certified optimization track when competing with solver without proof logging
    certifying correctness of results.
    As last year, many of the other best solvers were built on top of the 
    <em>RoundingSat</em> code base.

  <li>
    Great news from the
    <a href="http://satisfiability.org/SAT24/">International Conference on
      Theory and Applications of Satisfiability Testing</a>
    in August 2024!
    <ol>
      
      <li>
	For the second year,
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB"><em>VeriPB</em></a>
	was used as one of the proof checkers in the
	<a href="https://satcompetition.github.io/2024/">SAT Competition</a>,
	allowing solvers to use the full range of advanced solving techniques.
	We showed that just taking a previously existing SAT solver and doing nothing more
	than adding this proof logging support was enough to get a silver medal in the competition.
	
      <li>
	<em>VeriPB</em>
	was also used in the
	<a href="https://www.cril.univ-artois.fr/PB24/">Pseudo-Boolean Competition</a>,
	where our solver
	<a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/roundingsat"><em>RoundingSat</em></a>
	was one of the contestants.
	In the optimization track, 9&nbsp;out of the 12&nbsp;best solvers were based on the <em>RoundingSat</em> code base,
	and the original <em>RoundingSat</em> solver was the best one for both decision and optimization problems
	when certificates of correctness were required.
	
      <li>
	Former MIAO group PhD student Stephan Gocht was a runner-up for the  
	<em>SAT Association Fahiem Bacchus PhD Award in Satisfiability</em>.
	
      <li>
	And as another sign of the impact of our research, the SAT best paper was dedicated to a theoretical analysis
	of the proof system developed for <em>VeriPB</em>,
	while the best student paper investigated ways of improving <em>RoundingSat</em>.

  About my research
</h2>

<p>
  Computers are everywhere today&mdash;at work, in our cars, in our
  living rooms, and even in our pockets&mdash;and have changed the world
  beyond our wildest imagination. Yet these marvellous devices are, at
  the core, amazingly simple and stupid: all they can do is to
  mechanically shuffle around zeros and ones. What is the true
  potential of such automated computational devices? And what are the
  limits of what can be done by mindless calculations? Finding answers to
  this kind of questions is ultimately what my research is about.
</p>

<p>
  <em>Computational complexity theory</em> gives these deep
  and fascinating philosophical questions a crisp mathematical
  meaning. A computational problem is any task that is in principle
  amenable to being solved by a computer&mdash;i.e., it can be worked out
  by mechanical application of mathematical steps. By constructing
  general, abstract models of computers we can study how to design
  efficient methods, or <em>algorithms</em>, for solving different tasks, but
  also prove mathematical theorems showing that some computational
  problems just cannot be solved efficiently for inherent reasons
  (meaning that is impossible to design algorithms for them that are
  as efficient as we would like).
</p>

<p>
  I am particularly interested in understanding <em>combinatorial
    optimization problems</em>, which are of fundamental mathematical
  importance but also have wide-ranging applications in industry. My
  goal is, on the one hand, to prove formally that many such problems
  are beyond the reach of current algorithmic techniques, but also, on
  the other hand, to develop new algorithms that have the potential to
  go significantly beyond the current state of the art.
  
  In the last few years,
  I have also been doing research on how complexity theory can be
  harnessed to produce certificates that algorithms are actually
  computing correct results. It is an open secret in combinatorial
  optimization that even the most mature optimization tools in
  academica and industry sometimes produce wrong answers, but there
  has been no really principled way of addressing this problem.  Our
  work has started to change this state of affairs.

  <a href="miao-group/#about">presentation of my research group</a>
