  Executive Summary
</h2>

<p>
  The
  <strong><em>2nd International Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and
    Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS&nbsp;'25)</em></strong>
  <!--  will be -->
  was
  held on
  <strong>September 13-14, 2025,</strong>
  at
  <strong><a href="https://www.institut-pascal.universite-paris-saclay.fr/">Institut Pascal</a>
    in Orsay</strong>
  on the outskirts of Paris in coordination with the
  <em><a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2-symposium/">EuroProofNet Workshop on
    Automated Reasoning and Proof Logging</a></em>, 
  which
  <!-- is -->
  was
  in turn part of the
  <em><a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/Symposium/">Final EuroProofNet Symposium</a></em>.
</p>

  <a name="background"></a>
  Background and Purpose
</h2>

<p>
  Since the turn of the millennium there have been dramatic
  improvements in algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization. The flipside of this is that as the methods get
  increasingly sophisticated, it becomes increasingly harder to avoid
  bugs sneaking in during algorithm design and implementation, and
  even the most mature tools currently available struggle with
  incorrect results.
  Software testing, while important, has not been sufficient to
  resolve this problem, and formal verification methods are far from
  being able to scale to the level of complexity in modern
  combinatorial solvers. During the last twenty years the Boolean
  satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead spearheaded the use of
  <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer to a
  problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct.
  Such solvers are also referred to as <em>certifying algorithms</em>.
</p>

<p>
  For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger
  paradigms in combinatorial solving and optimization
  have met with limited success,
  but this has changed in the last few years with the introduction of
  <em>pseudo-Boolean (PB) proof logging</em>.
  Pseudo-Boolean proofs operate with 0-1 integer linear inequalities
  using a version of the cutting planes proof system, but have turned
  out to be a very convenient format also for algorithms that reason
  in terms of very different concepts.

  The
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  tool developed by the
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
      Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group in Copenhagen/Lund
  and its collaborators

  has so far been shown to support efficient proof logging for paradigms such as
  SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
  pseudo-Boolean optimization,
  subgraph solving, 
  constraint programming,
  automated planning,
  and
  presolving techniques in 0-1 integer linear programming,
  as well as for techniques such as symmetry breaking and dynamic programming.
  
</p>

<p>
  These developments have been so fast that in 2024 the fairly
  spontaneous idea arose to gather researchers 
  working on pseudo-Boolean proof logging to an informal gathering,
  which&mdash;reflecting the rather improvised nature of the
  event&mdash;was named the
  <a href="../WHOOPS24/"><em>1st Workshop on Highlights in
      Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS&nbsp;'24)</em></a>.
  
  This year, the second edition of the workshop
  <!-- will be -->
  was
  held on September 13-14
  in Orsay outside Paris under the auspices of 
  <a href="http://europroofnet.github.io/">EuroProofNet</a>.

  In addition to offering a healthy dose of pseudo-Boolean proof  logging,
  the purpose of <em>WHOOPS</em>
  <!-- is -->
  has evolved 
  to provide a forum for discussing
  certifying algorithms for automated reasoning more broadly,
  including satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving and first-
  and higher-order theorem proving.

<h2><a name="titles-abstracts"></a>Titles and Abstracts of Presentations</h2>


<h3>
  <a name="jakob-nordstrom">An introduction to pseudo-Boolean proof logging</a>
  (Jakob Nordström, University of Copenhagen and Lund University)
</h3>

<p>
  This talk is intended to give an overview of <em>VeriPB</em>, a
  proof system based on pseudo-Boolean reasoning with 0-1 integer
  linear inequalities that seems well suited to provide a unified
  proof logging method for a wide range of problems in discrete
  combinatorial solving and optimization.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="ciaran-mccreesh">Proof logging for subgraph solving</a>
  (Ciaran McCreesh, University of Glasgow)
  </h3>

<p>  
  Many interesting problems involve finding a little graph inside a
  bigger graph: for example, maximum clique asks for the largest set
  of vertices where everything is adjacent, whilst subgraph
  isomorphism asks whether a specific pattern occurs inside a given
  target graph. Although these problems are computationally hard in
  theory, in practice solvers can often handle these problems
  extremely quickly, even on graphs with thousands of
  vertices. However, these solvers are not always perfect, and
  sometimes contain bugs that lead to wrong answers being
  produced. I'll explain how, using the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system, we can
  augment these solvers to produce correctness certificates, allowing
  us to be confident they have definitely given the right answers. To
  do this, we'll need to be able to justify a wide range of
  algorithmic inference steps, including colour bounds, all-different
  filtering, and degree reasoning; perhaps surprisingly, <em>VeriPB</em> is
  able to do all of these efficiently, despite not having any notion
  of what a graph is.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="matthew-mcilree">Pseudo-Boolean proof logging for constraint programming</a>
  (Matthew McIlree, University of Glasgow)
</h3>

<p>  
  Constraint programming (CP) is an expressive paradigm for modelling and
  solving problems stated in terms of finite-domain variables and
  arbitrary constraints. Many CP solvers are based on backtracking
  search, with interleaved propagation algorithms, which use
  sophisticated inference procedures to reduce the search space by
  filtering inconsistent values from the domains of variables.
</p>

<p>
  This talk will be a tutorial on how we can modify a standard CP
  solver architecture to allow it to output a trustworthy and
  efficiently checkable certificate of correctness, both for
  satisfaction and optimisation problems. We'll see how pseudo-Boolean
  reasoning can be used to represent and derive facts about integer
  variables, linear inequalities, and even higher-level constraints
  such as "AllDifferent" (requiring a subset of variables to all take
  different values).
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="wietze-koops">Proof logging for pseudo-Boolean optimization</a>
  (Wietze Koops, Lund University and University of Copenhagen)
</h3>

<p>
  Certifying solvers have long been standard for Boolean
  satisfiability (SAT), allowing for proof logging and checking with
  very limited overhead. While pseudo-Boolean proof logging has shown
  great potential to support proof logging for a wide range of
  combinatorial optimization paradigms, overheads have in most cases
  been far from what is required for real-world deployment. In this
  talk, I will show how to implement proof logging for pseudo-Boolean
  optimization, including techniques such as core-guided search and
  linear programming integration with Farkas certificates and cut
  generation, with a focus on how to ensure that proof logging and
  checking is efficient. Our experimental evaluation shows that proof
  logging and checking performance is now quite close to the level of
  SAT solving, and hence clearly practically feasible.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="andy-oertel">Proof logging for preprocessing/presolving in MaxSAT and 0-1 integer linear programming</a>
  (Andy Oertel, Lund University and University of Copenhagen)
</h3>

<p>
  It is well-known that reformulating maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT)
  and mixed-integer programming (MIP) problems before solving is
  crucial for performance. While the overall goal of this reformulation
  process is the same in both communities, the concrete
  techniques used for preprocessing in MaxSAT and presolving in MIP
  are quite different. To ensure the correctness of different
  reformulations, all transformations must preserve the feasibility
  status and optimal value of the problem, but there is currently no
  established methodology to express and certify the equivalence
  between two optimization problems.
</p>

<p>
  In this talk, it is presented how pseudo-Boolean proof logging can
  be used to certify the correctness of a wide range of modern MIP
  presolving and MaxSAT preprocessing techniques. By combining and
  extending the <em>VeriPB</em> and <em>CakePB</em> tools, we obtain a formally verified
  end-to-end proof checking toolchain to verify the correctness of
  problem reformulations.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="markus-anders">Proof logging for symmetry breaking</a>
  (Markus Anders, RPTU Kaiserslautern-Landau)
</h3>

<p>
  Symmetry breaking is an indispensable technique when solving many
  interesting practical and mathematical problems. However, reasoning
  with symmetries is delicate and error-prone. Thus, correctness is an
  important concern. I will begin by giving a gentle introduction to
  symmetry breaking in SAT. Then I will show how these techniques can
  be proven correct using the so-called dominance rule. Lastly, I will
  briefly discuss recent progress and remaining challenges.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="yong-kiam-tan">End-to-end verification for subgraph solving [demo]</a>
  (Yong Kiam Tan,
  Institute for Infocomm Research,
  A*STAR, and Nanyang Technological University)  
</h3>

<p>
  This is a demo-focused talk for the paper "End-to-End Verification
  for Subgraph Solving" (AAAI&nbsp;'24). I will give a brief tour of the
  <em>CakePB</em> codebase, showing how to build and formally verify an
  encoder frontend for certifying maximum clique size using
  pseudo-Booleam proofs. I will demonstrate the "end-to-end" part of
  <em>CakePB</em> verification---a correctness theorem that goes from the
  high-level mathematical semantics of cliques down to a machine-code
  correctness theorem about the executable proof checker.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="arthur-gontier">A variety of trimming techniques for pseudo-Boolean proof logs</a>
  (Arthur Gontier, University of Glasgow)
</h3>

<p>
  Trimming of proofs can be performed for multiple reasons. The most
  important purpose of trimming is to reduce proof checking time, but
  we can also think of situations where we want to be able to save as
  small a proof as possible as a certificate, or to use a proof to
  provide an explanation why a set of constraints is contradiction. We
  are developing tools for performing these tasks, and will present
  the main ideas behind the implementation as well as some early
  results.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="simon-dold">Pseudo-Boolean proof logging for optimal classical planning</a>
  (Simon Dold, University of Basel)
</h3>

<p>  
  The solution to an optimal planning task is a sequence of actions with
  minimal cost that leads from the initial state to a goal
  state. Optimal planning is <em>PSPACE</em>-complete, and different approaches
  are used in practice to find an optimal solution. We introduce
  lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can be
  used to prove the optimality of a solution in a way that can be
  verified by an independent third party. We describe a general
  framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on
  pseudo-Boolean constraints, which is agnostic to the planning
  algorithm used. We also demonstrate how to modify the A∗ algorithm to
  produce proofs of optimality.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="adrian-rebola-pardo">Short, composable proofs without interference</a>
  (Adrian Rebola-Pardo, TU Wien)
</h3>

  Interference is a phenomenon where inference rules in several
  practice-oriented proof systems (including the <em>DRAT</em> family and
  <em>VeriPB</em>) depend on the whole derived formula rather than specific
  derived clauses. While these rules generally allow more concise
  reasoning than interference-free proofs, interference prevents
  proofs from being easily composable. This creates many problems for
  trimming, proof logging in incremental solvers, and proof system
  design. This talk presents a novel approach to proof logging based
  on propositional dynamic logic, a multimodal logic that seems to
  suitable capture the semantics of interference-based reasoning
  without being itself affected by interference. I will also discuss
  how this can be leveraged to solve some limitations on existing
  proof systems.

  <a name="florian-pollitt">Proof Logging in <em>CaDiCaL</em></a>
  (Florian Pollitt, Universität Freiburg)
</h3>

<p>

  This talks focuses on showcasing the state-of-the-art proof-logging
  support of the <em>CaDiCaL</em> SAT solver, covering a range of
  applications. Within this context, and from the perspective of a
  solver developer, I will discuss different needs and design
  decisions of proof formats and their impact on the development of
  <em>CaDiCaL</em>.

  <a name="ruth-hoffmann">Symmetry breaking in the subgraph isomorphism problem</a>
  (Ruth Hoffmann, University of St Andrews)
</h3>

<p>
  The subgraph isomorphism problem (SIP) asks, given a smaller
  (pattern) graph can we find it inside a larger (target) graph? The
  combinatorial search techniques used to answer this question follow
  the approaches used in SAT and CP, and thus should benefit from
  symmetry breaking.
</p>
 
<p>
  We are introducing novel methods for symmetry breaking for SIP, both
  static and dynamic which can be applied to pattern graphs
  (variables) or target graphs (values). These techniques are rooted
  in group theory and are generic enough to be applicable to (almost)
  any combinatorial search problem.
</p>
 
<p>
  The question that remains is, are we still solving the correct
  problem? I will talk through the correctness challenges we have
  encountered in the development of the technique, as well as the
  challenges that we are facing when going from a decision to an
  enumeration problem. This will hopefully lead to a discussion around
  how proof logging of symmetry breaking constraints might work.

<p>  
  This talk will outline my previous work on formalizing constraint
  solving with finite domains in a theorem prover. I will also share
  some thoughts on the alternative approach, proof logging, and proof
  verification.

  (Daniel Le Berre, Université d'Artois)
</h3>

<p>
  <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging has now been implemented fully in <em>Sat4j</em>, both
  for the resolution-based and the cutting-planes based solvers.  The
  proofs produced during the PB25 competition have been verified
  successfully. This talk will discuss the lessons learned while
  integrating <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging in <em>Sat4j</em>.

<h2>
  <a name="about-miao"></a>About the MIAO Research Group</h2>

<p>  
  The
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
    Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group is based on both sides of the &Oslash;resund Bridge at the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>.

  The  group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems.
  
  This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct
  in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but
  where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and
  unexpected and exciting synergies often arise.
</p>

<p>
  We are closely affiliated with the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>,
  and are part of a world-leading environment in algorithms and
  complexity theory encompassing also the
  <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.

  We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious,
  creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of
  mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in
  algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational
  research, algorithms and complexity researchers in Copenhagen
  have a track record of surprising algorithmic
  discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
