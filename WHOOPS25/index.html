  Executive Summary
</h2>

<p>
  The
  <strong><em>2nd International Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and
    Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS&nbsp;'25)</em></strong>
  will be held on
  <strong>September 13-14, 2025,</strong>
  at
  <strong><a href="https://www.institut-pascal.universite-paris-saclay.fr/">Institut Pascal</a>
    in Orsay</strong>
  on the outskirts of Paris in coordination with the
  <em><a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2-symposium/">EuroProofNet Workshop on
    Automated Reasoning and Proof Logging</a></em>, 
  which is in turn part of the
  <em><a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2-symposium/">Final EuroProofNet Symposium</a></em>.
</p>

  Background and Purpose
</h2>

<p>
  Since the turn of the millennium there have been dramatic
  improvements in algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization. The flipside of this is that as the methods get
  increasingly sophisticated, it becomes increasingly harder to avoid
  bugs sneaking in during algorithm design and implementation, and
  even the most mature tools currently available struggle with
  incorrect results.
  Software testing, while important, has not been sufficient to
  resolve this problem, and formal verification methods are far from
  being able to scale to the level of complexity in modern
  combinatorial solvers. During the last ten years the Boolean
  satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead spearheaded the use of
  <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer to a
  problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct.
  Such solvers are also referred to as <em>certifying algorithms</em>.
</p>

<p>
  For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger
  paradigms in combinatorial solving and optimization
  <!--
      algorithmic paradigms such as SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
      constraint programming, mixed integer linear programming, and
      automated planning
    -->
  have met with limited success,

  but has changed in the last few years with the introduction of
  <em>pseudo-Boolean (PB) proof logging</em>.
  Pseudo-Boolean proofs operate with 0-1 integer linear inequalities
  using a version of the cutting planes proof system, but have turned
  out to be a very convenient format also for algorithms that reason
  in terms of very different concepts.

  The
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  tool developed by the
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
      Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group in Copenhagen/Lund
  and its collaborators

  has so far been shown to support efficient proof logging for paradigms such as
  SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
  pseudo-Boolean optimization,
  subgraph solving, 
  constraint programming,
  automated planning,
  and
  presolving techniques in 0-1 integer linear programming,
  as well as for techniques such as symmetry breaking and dynamic programming.
  
</p>

<p>
  These developments have been so fast that in 2024 the fairly
  spontaneous idea arose to gather researchers in Europe
  working on pseudo-Boolean proof logging to an informal gathering,
  which&mdash;reflecting the rather improvised nature of the
  event&mdash;was named the
  <a href="../WHOOPS24/"><em>1st Workshop on Highlights in
      Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS&nbsp;'24)</em></a>.
  
  This year, the second edition of the event will be held on September 13-14
  in Orsay outside Paris under the auspices of 
  <a href="http://europroofnet.github.io/">EuroProofNet</a>,
  and will also welcome contributions regarding certifying algorithms for
  automated reasoning more broadly, including satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving
  and first- and higher-order theorem proving.

<h3>
  <a name="jakob-nordstrom">Jakob Nordström:</a>
  A one-size-fits-all proof logging system? 	
</h3>

<p>
  This talk is intended to give an overview of <em>VeriPB</em>, a proof system based on pseudo-Boolean reasoning with 0-1 integer linear inequalities that seems well suited to provide a unified proof logging method for discrete combinatorial problems. We have implemented <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging, together with efficient proof checking, for state-of-the-art solvers in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT solving), graph solving, constraint programming, and a growing list of other combinatorial solving paradigms. We believe there are reasons to hope that ideas from <em>VeriPB</em> could be useful also in the context of mixed integer linear programming, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving, automated planning, and possibly also other combinatorial solving paradigms, and will briefly review these and other future research directions in pseudo-Boolean proof logging.
</p>

<p>
Based on joint work with Jeremias Berg, Bart Bogaerts, Jan Elffers, Ambros Gleixner, Stephan Gocht, Alexander Hoen, Hannes Ihalainen, Matti Järvisalo, Ciaran McCreesh, Matthew McIlree, Magnus O. Myreen, Andy Oertel, Yong Kiam Tan, and Dieter Vandesande.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="bart-bogaerts">Bart Bogaerts:</a>
  Certified symmetry breaking with <em>VeriPB</em> 
</h3>

<p>
I will start by giving an overview of (static and dynamic) symmetry handling methods for SAT. Next, I will dive into details about strengthening rules in the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system and discuss every step of a detailed worked example, demonstrating how to do fully automated static symmetry breaking for SAT in a certified way.
Finally, I will discuss an open challenge on how to get certification for a framework such as SAT modulo symmetries, and particularly, the question of what it even means to certify this method. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="ciaran-mccreesh">Ciaran McCreesh:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof logging for things that aren't pseudo-Boolean
</h3>

<p>
We've heard a lot about pseudo-Boolean proof logging, but what do we do if our problems aren't pseudo-Boolean and our solvers don't search for cutting planes proofs? I'll showcase a range of applications where <em>VeriPB</em> has been successfully deployed, including subgraph problems like maximum clique and subgraph isomorphism; constraint programming; and if time permits, dynamic programming. These results suggest that for some reason, extended cutting planes seems to be a really helpful way of certifying a wide range of techniques used in combinatorial solving algorithms.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="matthew-mcilree">Matthew McIlree:</a>
  Proof logging for some interesting constraint propagation algorithms
</h3>

<p>
In this talk, I will explain some non-trivial propagators used in constraint programming solvers, and describe how they can be modified to justify their reasoning within the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="dieter-vandesande">Dieter Vandesande:</a>
  Proof logging for <em>MaxCDCL</em> and BDDs
</h3>

<p>
In earlier work, MaxSAT solvers implementing both solution-improving and core-guided search have been made certifying using the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system. In this talk, I will show the recent developments and ongoing work on proof logging a solver implementing a third solving paradigm: Branch-and-Bound search. More specifically, will we cover the solver <em>MaxCDCL</em>, which combines Branch-and-Bound search with the power of clause learning as it is implemented in SAT solvers. <em>MaxCDCL</em> also makes use of a PB-to-CNF encoding based on BDD's, and we will also show how to provide proof logging for that.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="hannes-ihalainen">Hannes Ihalainen:</a>
  Certified MaxSAT preprocessing
</h3>

<p>
Building on the progress in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving over the last decades, maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) has become a viable approach for solving NP-hard optimization problems. However, ensuring correctness of MaxSAT solvers has remained a considerable concern. For SAT, this is largely a solved problem thanks to the use of proof logging, meaning that solvers emit machine-verifiable proofs to certify correctness. However, for MaxSAT, proof logging solvers have started being developed only very recently. Moreover, these nascent efforts have only targeted the core solving process, ignoring the preprocessing phase where input problem instances can be substantially reformulated before being passed on to the solver proper.
</p>

<p>
In this work, we demonstrate how pseudo-Boolean proof logging can be used to certify the correctness of a wide range of modern MaxSAT preprocessing techniques. By combining and extending the <em>VeriPB</em> and <em>CakePB</em> tools, we provide formally verified end-to-end proof checking that the input and preprocessed output MaxSAT problem instances have the same optimal value. An extensive evaluation on applied MaxSAT benchmarks shows that our approach is feasible in practice.
</p>

<p>
The talk is based on the work "Certified MaxSAT Preprocessing" by Hannes Ihalainen, Andy Oertel, Yong Kiam Tan, Jeremias Berg, Matti Järvisalo, Magnus O. Myreen, and Jakob Nordström that appeared at IJCAR 2024.
</p>


<h3>
  <a name="andy-oertel">Andy Oertel:</a>
  Certifying MIP-based presolve reductions for 0–1 integer linear programs
</h3>

<p>
It is well known that reformulating the original problem can be crucial for the performance of mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers. To ensure correctness, all transformations must preserve the feasibility status and optimal value of the problem, but there is currently no established methodology to express and verify the equivalence of two mixed-integer programs. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by showing how the correctness of MIP presolve reductions on 0-1 integer linear programs can be certified by using (and suitably extending) the <em>VeriPB</em> tool for pseudo-Boolean proof logging. Our experimental evaluation on both decision and optimization instances demonstrates the computational viability of the approach and leads to suggestions for future revisions of the proof format that will help to reduce the verbosity of the certificates and to accelerate the certification and verification process further.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="joseph-loughney">Joseph Loughney:</a>
  Symmetry breaking in the subgraph isomorphism problem
</h3>

<p>
The Subgraph Isomorphism Problem has many applications, including bioinformatics, computer vision and graph databases. Current state-of-the-art solvers using constraints programming techniques can handle cases with up to 1000 pattern vertices and 10,000 target vertices. Symmetry breaking techniques have shown promising results in improving the efficiency of algorithms for similar combinatorial problems; presented here are two strategies for implementing symmetry breaking using stabiliser chains, alongside initial experimental results.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="arthur-gontier">Arthur Gontier:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof trimming
</h3>

<p>
Proof trimming may be used to get a smaller proof, a shorter verification time or to gain some knowledge on the solving method that generated the proof. In this talk, we will present some early results of a trimmer we made for CP proofs on Subgraph Isomorphism Problems, and we open the discussion on several trimming ideas.
