  Executive Summary
</h2>

<p>
  The
  <strong><em>2nd International Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and
    Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS&nbsp;'25)</em></strong>
  will be held on
  <strong>September 13-14, 2025,</strong>
  at
  <strong><a href="https://www.institut-pascal.universite-paris-saclay.fr/">Institut Pascal</a>
    in Orsay</strong>
  on the outskirts of Paris in coordination with the
  <em><a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/wg2-symposium/">EuroProofNet Workshop on
    Automated Reasoning and Proof Logging</a></em>, 
  which is in turn part of the
  <em><a href="https://europroofnet.github.io/Symposium/">Final EuroProofNet Symposium</a></em>.
</p>

<h2>
  <a name="background"></a>
  Background and Purpose
</h2>

<p>
  Since the turn of the millennium there have been dramatic
  improvements in algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization. The flipside of this is that as the methods get
  increasingly sophisticated, it becomes increasingly harder to avoid
  bugs sneaking in during algorithm design and implementation, and
  even the most mature tools currently available struggle with
  incorrect results.
  Software testing, while important, has not been sufficient to
  resolve this problem, and formal verification methods are far from
  being able to scale to the level of complexity in modern
  combinatorial solvers. During the last twenty years the Boolean
  satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead spearheaded the use of
  <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer to a
  problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct.
  Such solvers are also referred to as <em>certifying algorithms</em>.
</p>

<p>
  For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger
  paradigms in combinatorial solving and optimization
  <!--
      algorithmic paradigms such as SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
      constraint programming, mixed integer linear programming, and
      automated planning
    -->
  have met with limited success,

  but this has changed in the last few years with the introduction of
  <em>pseudo-Boolean (PB) proof logging</em>.
  Pseudo-Boolean proofs operate with 0-1 integer linear inequalities
  using a version of the cutting planes proof system, but have turned
  out to be a very convenient format also for algorithms that reason
  in terms of very different concepts.

  The
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  tool developed by the
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
      Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group in Copenhagen/Lund
  and its collaborators

  has so far been shown to support efficient proof logging for paradigms such as
  SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
  pseudo-Boolean optimization,
  subgraph solving, 
  constraint programming,
  automated planning,
  and
  presolving techniques in 0-1 integer linear programming,
  as well as for techniques such as symmetry breaking and dynamic programming.
  
</p>

<p>
  These developments have been so fast that in 2024 the fairly
  spontaneous idea arose to gather researchers 
  working on pseudo-Boolean proof logging to an informal gathering,
  which&mdash;reflecting the rather improvised nature of the
  event&mdash;was named the
  <a href="../WHOOPS24/"><em>1st Workshop on Highlights in
      Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems (WHOOPS&nbsp;'24)</em></a>.
  
  This year, the second edition of the workshop will be held on September 13-14
  in Orsay outside Paris under the auspices of 
  <a href="http://europroofnet.github.io/">EuroProofNet</a>.

  In addition to a healthy dose of pseudo-Boolean proof
  logging,


  we are very much hoping to also discuss certifying
  algorithms for automated reasoning more broadly, including
  satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving and first- and
  higher-order theorem proving.

  Workshop Program
</h2>

  More information about the program will be available closer to the workshop.  

  The tentative plans are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Saturday will probably mostly consist of slightly longer, tutorial-style, talks, explaining how
    pseudo-Boolean proof logging can support efficient certified solving for paradigms such as
    SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
    pseudo-Boolean optimization,
    subgraph solving,
    constraint programming,
    automated planning, as well as for techniques such as symmetry breaking and dynamic programming.
  <li>
    On Sunday we will have contributed talks, where we might still
    have some presentations of the very latest news in pseudo-Boolean
    proof logging, but where we are very much hoping to also discuss
    certifying algorithms for automated reasoning more broadly,
    including satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving and first-

  End-to-end verification for subgraph solving (demo)
</h3>

<p>
  This is a demo-focused talk for the paper "End-to-End Verification
  for Subgraph Solving" (AAAI'24). I will give a brief tour of
  CakePB's codebase, showing how to build and formally verify an
  encoder frontend for certifying maximum clique size using
  pseudo-Booleam proofs. I will demonstrate the "end-to-end" part of
  CakePB's verification---a correctness theorem that goes from the
  high-level mathematical semantics of cliques down to a machine-code
  correctness theorem about the executable proof checker.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="simon-dold">Simon Dold:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof logging for optimal classical planning
</h3>

<p>  
  The solution to an optimal planning task is a sequence of actions with
  minimal cost that leads from the initial state to a goal
  state. Optimal planning is PSPACE-complete, and different approaches
  are used in practice to find an optimal solution. We introduce
  lower-bound certificates for classical planning tasks, which can be
  used to prove the optimality of a solution in a way that can be
  verified by an independent third party. We describe a general
  framework for generating lower-bound certificates based on
  pseudo-Boolean constraints, which is agnostic to the planning
  algorithm used. We also demonstrate how to modify the A∗ algorithm to
  produce proofs of optimality.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="adrian-rebola-pardo">Adrian Rebola-Pardo:</a>
  Short, composable proofs without interference
</h3>

<p>
  Interference is a phenomenon where inference rules in several
  practice-oriented proof systems (including the DRAT family and
  VeriPB) depend on the whole derived formula rather than specific
  derived clauses. While these rules generally allow more concise
  reasoning than interference-free proofs, interference prevents
  proofs from being easily composable. This creates many problems for
  trimming, proof logging in incremental solvers, and proof system
  design. This talk presents a novel approach to proof logging based
  on propositional dynamic logic, a multimodal logic that seems to
  suitable capture the semantics of interference-based reasoning
  without being itself affected by interference. I will also discuss
  how this can be leveraged to solve some limitations on existing
  proof systems.
</p>
 

<h3>
  <a name="ruth-hoffmann">Ruth Hoffmann:</a>
  Symmetry breaking in the subgraph isomorphism problem
</h3>

<p>
  The subgraph isomorphism problem (SIP) asks, given a smaller
  (pattern) graph can we find it inside a larger (target) graph? The
  combinatorial search techniques used to answer this question follow
  the approaches used in SAT and CP, and thus should benefit from
  symmetry breaking.
</p>
 
<p>
  We are introducing novel methods for symmetry breaking for SIP, both
  static and dynamic which can be applied to pattern graphs
  (variables) or target graphs (values). These techniques are rooted
  in group theory and are generic enough to be applicable to (almost)
  any combinatorial search problem.
</p>
 
<p>
  The question that remains is, are we still solving the correct
  problem? I will talk through the correctness challenges we have
  encountered in the development of the technique, as well as the
  challenges that we are facing when going from a decision to an
  enumeration problem. This will hopefully lead to a discussion around
  how proof logging of symmetry breaking constraints might work.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="jakob-nordstrom">Jakob Nordström:</a>
  A one-size-fits-all proof logging system? 	
</h3>

<p>
  This talk is intended to give an overview of <em>VeriPB</em>, a proof system based on pseudo-Boolean reasoning with 0-1 integer linear inequalities that seems well suited to provide a unified proof logging method for discrete combinatorial problems. We have implemented <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging, together with efficient proof checking, for state-of-the-art solvers in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT solving), graph solving, constraint programming, and a growing list of other combinatorial solving paradigms. We believe there are reasons to hope that ideas from <em>VeriPB</em> could be useful also in the context of mixed integer linear programming, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving, automated planning, and possibly also other combinatorial solving paradigms, and will briefly review these and other future research directions in pseudo-Boolean proof logging.
</p>

<p>
Based on joint work with Jeremias Berg, Bart Bogaerts, Jan Elffers, Ambros Gleixner, Stephan Gocht, Alexander Hoen, Hannes Ihalainen, Matti Järvisalo, Ciaran McCreesh, Matthew McIlree, Magnus O. Myreen, Andy Oertel, Yong Kiam Tan, and Dieter Vandesande.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="ciaran-mccreesh">Ciaran McCreesh:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof logging for things that aren't pseudo-Boolean
</h3>

<p>
We've heard a lot about pseudo-Boolean proof logging, but what do we do if our problems aren't pseudo-Boolean and our solvers don't search for cutting planes proofs? I'll showcase a range of applications where <em>VeriPB</em> has been successfully deployed, including subgraph problems like maximum clique and subgraph isomorphism; constraint programming; and if time permits, dynamic programming. These results suggest that for some reason, extended cutting planes seems to be a really helpful way of certifying a wide range of techniques used in combinatorial solving algorithms.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="matthew-mcilree">Matthew McIlree:</a>
  Proof logging for some interesting constraint propagation algorithms
</h3>

<p>
In this talk, I will explain some non-trivial propagators used in constraint programming solvers, and describe how they can be modified to justify their reasoning within the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="andy-oertel">Andy Oertel:</a>
  Certifying MIP-based presolve reductions for 0–1 integer linear programs
</h3>

<p>
It is well known that reformulating the original problem can be crucial for the performance of mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers. To ensure correctness, all transformations must preserve the feasibility status and optimal value of the problem, but there is currently no established methodology to express and verify the equivalence of two mixed-integer programs. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by showing how the correctness of MIP presolve reductions on 0-1 integer linear programs can be certified by using (and suitably extending) the <em>VeriPB</em> tool for pseudo-Boolean proof logging. Our experimental evaluation on both decision and optimization instances demonstrates the computational viability of the approach and leads to suggestions for future revisions of the proof format that will help to reduce the verbosity of the certificates and to accelerate the certification and verification process further.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="arthur-gontier">Arthur Gontier:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof trimming
</h3>

<p>
Proof trimming may be used to get a smaller proof, a shorter verification time or to gain some knowledge on the solving method that generated the proof. In this talk, we will present some early results of a trimmer we made for CP proofs on Subgraph Isomorphism Problems, and we open the discussion on several trimming ideas.
