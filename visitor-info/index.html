<h2>
  <a name="directions-copenhagen-lund"></a>
  Getting to Copenhagen and/or Lund
</h2>

<p>
  If you are travelling by air, the
  <a href="https://www.cph.dk/en">Copenhagen Airport Kastrup (CPH)</a>
  is probably the most convenient option, although
  <a href="https://www.swedavia.com/malmo/">Malmö Airport (MMX)</a>
  in Sturup might also be an alternative.
</p>

<p>
  From Copenhagen Airport you can
  take the train to either Lund or central Copenhagen, and there is
  also a Copenhagen metro station at the airport.
</p>

<p>
  From Malmö Airport there are
  <a href="https://www.flygbussarna.se/en/malmo">airport buses</a>
  to Malmö, and then you can take a 10-minute train ride onwards to
  Lund  or cross the bridge to go to Copenhagen.
</p>


<h2>
  <a name="directions-diku"></a>
  Directions to the University of Copenhagen
</h2>

<p>
  To get from Copenhagen Airport to 
  <a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/">DIKU</a>,
  the Department of Computer Science at the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/en">University of Copenhagen</a>,
  which is located at N&oslash;rre Campus at
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/rSFZ4SR46x57FXRm6">Universitetsparken&nbsp;1</a>,
  one possibility is to
  take the train to N&oslash;rreport station (one stop after the
  central station K&oslash;benhavn H) and then follow the
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/u4fzNQ5d1SqM3QuP7">directions onwards to DIKU</a>
  spelled out in text below.
</p>

<p>
  If arriving to N&oslash;rreport with the train from K&oslash;benhavn H, 
  exit the train platform in the direction indicated by signs to buses.
  When coming up the stairs, keep going straight until the last bus stop on the left before you would have to cross a road (200 meters, maybe).
  This is close to Netto, Forex, and Gothersgade street.

  From that bus stop, take buses 15E, 150, or 185 to the bus stop Universitetsparken. This takes 5-10 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  When you get off the bus, cross the road to the left and then keep
  going straight in the direction of travel for a few hundred meters
  until you see a white sign for Faculty of Science, Department of
  Computer Science at N&oslash;rre Allé&nbsp;63B, Bygning&nbsp;771. Turn left there
  and try to get into the door. Then walk one flight of stairs up,
  take a right towards
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">BARC</a>,
  and take a right up the stairs again to the BARC second floor and
  ring the bell.

  My office is 3-1-09 (with a MIAO poster on the door).
  
  If we are slow to open, please try to text or call
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>
  or some other
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/#researchers">MIAO group member</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If the door from N&oslash;rre Allé is
  locked, then walk around the building and enter from the main
  entrance at Universitetsparken instead &mdash; in this case you take a
  right after the stairs immediately after the entrance and then a
  right again up to the second floor. 
</p>

<p>
  If you are close to a metro station then you can also take the metro
  line M3 to Vibenshus Runddel, from where you walk
  <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/6kcKK5hnhtbQWgdR8">half a kilometer
    along N&oslash;rre Allé</a>.
</p>

<p>


  You can download the DOT app for public transport tickets in
  Copenhagen at
  <a href="https://dinoffentligetransport.dk/en/find-tickets/dot-tickets-app">dinoffentligetransport.dk/en/find-tickets/dot-tickets-app</a>.
</p>


<h2>
  <a name="directions-lth"></a>
  Directions to Lund University
</h2>


<p>  
  To get from Copenhagen Airport to 
  the
  <a href="https://cs.lth.se/english/">Department of Computer Science</a>
  at the
  <a href="https://www.lth.se/english/">Faculty of Engineering (LTH)</a>
  at
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>,
  which is located at
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/c7jkwxJjso8xtvn28">Klas Anshelms väg&nbsp;10 /
    Ole Römers väg&nbsp;3</a>,
  take the
  <a href="https://www.oresundstag.se/en">Öresund commuter train</a>
  across the Öresund Bridge to Lund.

  <em>Please do not forget to bring your passport along, as you will
  be crossing the border between Sweden and Denmark and there are
  sometimes passport controls.</em>

  All commuter trains from Copenhagen to any destination in
  Sweden will pass through Lund ca 10 minutes after Malmö Central
  Station.
</p>

<p>
  The easiest way of buying tickets to Sweden might be to download the
  <a href="https://www.skanetrafiken.se/appen/">Skånetrafiken app</a>.
  You can adjust the settings so that you get e-mailed receipts for all purchases.
  There are also ticket machines at Copenhagen Airport.  
</p>

<p>
  The most convenient route onwards from Lund Central Station
  would seem to be to 
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ypA4rLJLSSWHAfLR8">take the tram to the "Lund LTH" stop</a>,
  which takes just a few minutes, and then walk from there a few
  minutes minutes more.
  If you are coming with the standard Öresund commuter train from
  Copenhagen, then the local public transport in Lund is included in
  your train ticket.
</p>

<p>
  To reach the tram stop, take the stairs at the middle exit of the
  platform at Lund Central Station (usually at the front of the train
  in the direction of travel if you are coming from Copenhagen/Malmö,
  or close to the first train cars), take a right, and then walk
  straight out of the train station and cross one small and one
  slightly larger street. Now you should see a bus stop to your left,
  and some 20-30 meters behind that bus stop there is a tram station.
</p>

<p>
  After getting off the tram at the "Lund LTH" stop, walk right to
  John Ericssons väg and continue straight, then take a right before
  you reach the Vattenhallen Science Center to reach the main entrance
  at Klas Anshelms väg 10. To get to the MIAO research group, bear
  right after you have entered the building and walk up the stairs one
  floor up, take a left turn and then immediately a right turn &mdash; you
  should now be in front of a locked door with a sign "Datavetenskap"
  (i.e., Computer Science). If anyone is there and
  opens for you, then just continue straight past a few doors until you see
  offices with MIAO posters on the doors.
  My office is 2130a.
  If you cannot get in, try to text or call
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>
  or some other
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/#researchers">MIAO group member</a>.
