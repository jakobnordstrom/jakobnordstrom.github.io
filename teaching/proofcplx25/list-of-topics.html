    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    None
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Should we also try to do the exp(n) upper bound for PHP?
    
  <li>
    Resolution and Tseitin formulas
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Urquhart '87, our notes
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    None
    <br>

    Do the upper bound for grid graphs;
    this will come in handy later.
    
  <li>
    Resolution and the clique problem (1/2)
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Atserias, Bonacina, de Rezende,
    Lauria, Nordström, &amp; Razborov:
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Clique lower bound for resolution
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    We will not be able to do the full proof,
    but it should be possible to get good
    problem set problems out of this.
    
  <li>
    Resolution and the clique problem (2/2)


  <li>
    Feasible interpolation for resolution

    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Interpolation is an important proof technique to understand.
    <br>        
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    We will assume the required monotone circuit lower bound as a given.

  <li>
    Resolution size-width lower bound
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Ben-Sasson &amp; Wigderson '01
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    None.
    Or actually: Maybe I should know this, but are the corresponding results for
    Sherali-Adams and sum-of-squares known to be tight?
    
  <li>
    Polynomial calculus and resolution
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Alekhnovich &amp; Razborov '03,
    Mik&#353;a &amp; Nordstr&ouml;m
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Combine immunity à la AR03
    with clustering à la MN24
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Talk about
    dual variables;
    simulation of resolution by polynomial calculus;
    resolution width and polynomial calculus degree lower bounds;
    separations between resolution and polynomial calculus
    
  <li>
    Polynomial calculus degree lower bounds
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Alekhnovich &amp; Razborov '03,
    Mik&#353;a &amp; Nordstr&ouml;m,
    and the papers which MN reproves
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    As listed in
    Mik&#353;a &amp; Nordstr&ouml;m
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Get lower bounds for random <em>k</em>-CNF formulas,
    FPHP,
    ordering principle formulas,
    et cetera,
    as corollaries.    

  <li>
    Polynomial calculus and graph colouring
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Conneryd et al. '23;
    probably also mention Beame et al. for resolution (do as warm-up?)
    and Lauria-Nordström '17 (which is strictly speaking incomparable, I believe)
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Graph homomorphism to 5-cycle,
    dense linear order
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Can we save substantial time by doing the lower bound only for 4-colouring?    

  <li>
    Tightness of relation between size and width/degree for
    resolution and polynomial calculus
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Stålmarck '96, 
    Bonet &amp; Galesi '01,
    Galesi &amp; Lauria '08,
    Atserias, Lauria, &amp; Nordström '16
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Are there similarly tight versions for clause space and monomial space
    (without blowing up formula size)?
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Bonet-Galesi show that BW01 cannot be improved (essentially).
    ALN shows that there are formulas refutable in width/degree w
    that require size n^w.
    
  <li>
    Space complexity in resolution and polynomial calculus;
    resolution clause space vs. width 
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Esteban-Torán,
    Alekhnovich et al.,
    Atserias &amp; Dalmau '08,
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    This lecture sets up the discussion of
    many open problems in ensuing lectures.
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Lots of results here that we can just mention without going into details.
    Mention also version of AD proof in Filmus et al., and maybe give as exercise.
    
  <li>
    Total space in resolution;
    polynomial calculus monomial space vs. width/degree
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Bonacina,
    Filmus, Lauria, Mik&#353;a, Nordstr&ouml;m &amp; Vinyals,
    Galesi-Kołodziejczyk-Thapen         
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Total space lower bounds for polynomial calculus,
    PC space \geq resolution width

  <li>
    Pebbling formulas,
    resolution space-width separation,
    and 
    resolution size-space trade-offs    
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Ben-Sasson &amp; Nordström '08, '11
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Get analogous results for polynomial calculus
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    This is very ambitious for just one lecture, but if we assume everything pebbling-related as black boxes
    and also leave many details as exercises it might be doable.
    Maybe do as problem set problem how to get size-space trade-offs for PC
    except for a log factor loss&mdash;otherwise this might actually be nice to do in class.
    
  <li>
    Supercritical resolution size-space trade-offs for Tseitin formulas
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Beame-Beck-Impagliazzo '16,
    Beck-Nordström-Tang '13
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Improve parameters!
    Get results for polynomial calculus that are independent of the characteristic.
    Extend to other proof systems (which seems plausible).
    
  <li>
    Polynomial calculus space lower bound for random <em>k</em>-CNF formulas
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Bonacina-Galesi,
    Filmus et al.
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Mention the many polynomial calculus space lower bounds that are open.
    
  <li>
    Size-degree trade-offs for Nullstellensatz and polynomial calculus
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    de Rezende, Meir, Nordström, &amp; Robere '21,
    Lagarde, Nordström, Sokolov, &amp; Swernofsky '20
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Similar results for Sherali-Adams and sum-of-squares.
    Trade-offs for Nullstellensatz with dual variables(?).

  <li>
    Polynomial calculus size lower bounds for roots of unity encodings
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Sokolov '20,
    our paper(?)
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Give a clean general result that says that if the CVIG
    is an expander and has property P, then PC {+-1} lower bounds follow.
    When can we get lower bounds over both {0,1} and {+-1}?
    Deal with more general extension variables.    
    
  <li>
    Cutting planes; more about
    feasible interpolation
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Pudlák '97
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Lots of open problems for cutting planes&hellip;
    Potentially discuss how different cut rules compare.
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Is there a better reference for the interpolation lower bounds than Pudlák?
    
  <li>
    Cutting planes lower bounds for random CNF formulas
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Hrube&#353; &amp; Pudlák '17,
    Fleming, Pankratov, Robere, &amp; Pitassi '21,    
    Sokolov '24
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    <em>k</em>-CNF formulas for constant <em>k</em>.
    Can the Sokolov technique be used for other problems?
    Can we do lower bounds for BPHP in the same way?
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Should we just a assume a perfect split of the variables
    to avoid a technical complication?
    
  <li>
    Size-space trade-offs for cutting planes (1/2)
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    de Rezende, Nordström, &amp; Vinyals '16
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Improve parameters substantially.
    Prove space lower bounds for CP^*.
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    When should we mention the constant line space upper bound for cutting planes
    due to Galesi, Pudlák, &amp; Thapen '15?
    dRNV would be the first nontrivial lifting result in the course.
    If we want to do it in detail (especially if we are not happy with
    CP^* but want CP, but even without this), then it seems reasonable
    to set aside two lectures.
    
  <li>
    Size-space trade-offs for cutting planes (2/2)

    
  <li>
    Trade-offs for
    cutting planes with polynomially bounded coefficients
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    de Rezende, Meir, Nordström, Pitassi, Robere, &amp; Vinyals '20    
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Separate CP and CP^* w.r.t. size, period.
    More direct lower bound for parity decision trees for pebbling.
    True size-space trade-offs for CP^*.
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    This would have to be a selective overview of the paper,
    since there are lots of technicalities.
    
  <li>
    Lower bounds for cutting planes size from resolution width using lifting
    (1/2)
    <br>        
    <strong>References:</strong>
    Garg, Göös, Kamath, &amp; Sokolov '20
    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    This is a key technique to understand for many of the most recent results.
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Which version do we want?
    For our supercritical trade-off paper the slightly different proof
    in the conference version was apparently more useful?
    
  <li>
    Lower bounds for cutting planes size from resolution width using lifting
    (2/2)
    
  <li>
    Sherali-Adams and the pigeonhole principle

    <br>    
    <strong>Open problems:</strong>
    Etablish many of the lower bounds we know for resolution and polynomial calculus?
    <br>    
    <strong>Questions/comments:</strong>
    Cover lower bound for PHP but not for graph-PHP;
    talk about duality    

  <li>
    Automatability for resolution and polynomial calculus
    <br>

    Atserias-Müller,

    Sherali-Adams,
    sum-of-squares,
