<h2><a name="short-overview">Short Overview</a></h2>

<p>
  Very simply put, proof complexity can be said to be the study of how
  to provide a short and efficiently verifiable certificate of the
  fact that a given propositional logic formula (typically in conjunctive
  normal form, or CNF) is unsatisfiable. Note that for <em>satisfiable</em>
  formulas there are very succinct certificates &mdash; just list a
  satisfying assignment &mdash; but for unsatisfiable formulas it is not
  quite clear what to do.
</p>

<p>
  It is widely believed that it is not possible in general 
  to give short
  certificates for unsatisfiable formulas, which if proven would imply
  <em>P</em> &ne; <em>NP</em>. 
  One important research direction in proof complexity is
  to approach this distant goal by establishing lower bounds for stronger and
  stronger proof systems.
</p>

<p>
  Another reason to study proof complexity is that any algorithm for
  deciding satisfiability of  CNF formulas, or of related objects
  such as systems of polynomial equalities or linear inequalities,
  uses some method of reasoning to determine whether the sets of constraints
  in the input are feasible or infeasible. 
  Studying the proof systems corresponding to these methods of
  reasoning and proving upper and lower bounds for them tells us
  something about the potential and limitations of such algorithms.
</p>

<p>
  As indicated by the title above, this seminar course is mainly
  motivated by the second reason, and will therefore focus on proof
  systems that are especially interesting from an algorithmic
  perspective.
  
  We will introduce the proof systems resolution, Nullstellensatz,
  polynomial calculus, cutting planes, and Sherali-Adams
  &mdash;
  corresponding to SAT solving, algebraic reasoning, and geometric reasoning
  &mdash;
  survey some of the major research results, and present some open problems
  right at the research frontier. 

  While the intention is to give a fairly broad coverage, there will be
  a slight bias towards topics where current and former members of 
  the
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/">Mathematical
    Insights into Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a>
  group
  and our collaborators have made significant contributions to the state of the art.

<h2><a name="schedule">Schedule and Course Contents</a></h2>

<!-- START OF SCHEDULE SECTION -->

<p>
  This seminar course
  is
  given during the winter 2025/26.
  
  It
  is planned to have a total of 25-30 lectures, 
  with two lectures per week on average.
</p>

<p>
  In accordance with the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_quarter_(class_timing)">academic 
    quarter</a>
  tradition,
  all times are stated <em>cum tempore</em>,
  so "13" in the lecture schedule below actually means "13:15".

  Regarding the length of the lectures, we will try to use some of the
  extra flexibility afforded between friends, going over two hours
  when the complexity of the materials requires it, but we will try
  not to use the full three hours in the schedule.
</p>
  
<p>
  Lectures in rooms starting with "E:" are at the
  <a href="https://www.cs.lth.se/en/">CS department</a>
  at
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>
  at 
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZpcHqr1aSB2fuS9U7">Klas Anshelms väg 10</a>.
  The other lectures will  be given in the premises of the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC)</a>
  centre at the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/en">University of Copenhagen</a>
  at
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Gq7gG4cbizmJhqjLA">Vibendshuset</a>.

  We also hope and plan to stream all lectures on Zoom and record
  them.
  Please contact
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>
  to get information about the Zoom links used.

    in future lectures is somewhat tentative. The planning might be
    revised as we go along.
