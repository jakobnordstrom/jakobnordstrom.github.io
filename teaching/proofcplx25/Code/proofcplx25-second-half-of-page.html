<p>
  The main lecturer is
  <a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/">Jakob Nordström</a>.
  Jakob will be giving the lectures together with 
  <a href="https://kilianrisse.github.io/">Kilian Risse</a>,
  who will also help out with grading of problem sets and
  feedback on scribed lecture notes.
</p>


<h2><a name="goals">Course Goals</a></h2>
  
<p>
  This seminar course is intended to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> give an introduction to proof complexity
    (partly with a view towards algorithmic connections),
  <li>
    survey some of the most recent exciting results in this area,
    and
  <li>
    present a number of open problems right at the frontier of
    current research,
</ul>
so that that students after having completed the course will
<ul>
  <li>
    have a good grasp of modern proof complexity (with a focus on proof systems corresponding to algoritms),
  <li>
    be able to reconstruct the proofs, at least in principle, of
    some of the major results during the last decades,
    and
  <li>
    be well equipped to attack open problems in the area (or
    will potentially already succesfully have done so).
</ul>


<h2><a name="requirements">Course Requirements</a></h2>

<p>
  This seminar course is intended to give 7.5 ECTS credits.
</p>

<p>
  The course examination will be by scribing notes for lectures
  (in LaTeX)
  and doing problem sets.
  More detailed information will be provided later.
</p>




<h2><a name="literature">Course Material</a></h2>


<p>
  This course will mostly be based on research papers, and so there is no textbook.
  We plan to produce scribe notes from the lectures to help students study the material
  (and also use this scribing process as the main form of examination).
</p>

<p>
  Below follow some information about resources that might be helpful.

<h3><a name="books-surveys">Books and Surveys</a></h3>


<p>
  The most recent comprehensive reference on proof complexity is the book
  (you guessed it)
  <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/proof-complexity/80BDF46F373753B475550D04F58098A3"><strong>Proof Complexity</strong></a>
  by Jan Krajíček.
</p>

<p>
  Some proof complexity survey articles by the main lecturer,
  which have more of an algorithmic perspective on proof complexity,
  are:

  Somewhat of a classic proof complexity survey is

<!-- START OF ARTICLE REFERENCES SECTION -->

<p>
  <em>
    Please note that this section is being updated as we go along.
  </em>
</p>


<p>
  Below follows a fairly complete list  of 
  research articles on which the lectures are based.

  Note that for most of the papers we will only discuss a selection of
  the results, and the lectures are intended to cover
  the material in the articles
  that we need, so students are <strong><em>not</em></strong> required to read
  the papers listed below &mdash; the references are provided for completeness and for
  students interested in further reading.
  It should also be noted that many of the proofs given in
  class are actually <strong><em>not</em></strong> those found in the papers, and
  more recent survey papers of an area can sometimes be better reads
  than the original research articles. Please do not hesitate to talk to the lecturers
  if you are interested in specific references for some specific area.
</p>

<p>
  Whenever available, links below are to the journal versions,
  <!-- (or full-length technical reports), -->
  which means that the date of the paper can sometimes be several 
  years later than that of the original conference publication.
  For papers by the lecturers, the links are to personal PDF copies of the
  published papers
  with icons <img src="pdf.gif" alt="PDF" border=0>
  rather than to publisher websites.

      Note that if you are not at the university, or if you are
      connected to the university network via wireless, then you might
      not be able to access the PDF files with the articles linked to
      above.  One way around this problem is to search for the titles
      of the papers in your favourite search engine&mdash;this should
      hopefully help you find free versions of the same papers on the
      webpages of the authors or similar.

  Scribe Notes

<p>  
  <em>
    Information about scribing and scribe notes remains to be added.
  </em>

    Please note that these scribe notes are provided "as is" without
    warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not
    limited to, the implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for
    a particular purpose.
    Having said that,  the notes are of course intended to be as useful 
    and correct as possible, so if you notice any errors or have any other 
    suggestions for improvements (regardless of whether you are taking the course 
    or just happen to visit this webpage), please do not hesitate to send

  Problem Sets
</h3>


<p>

  Part of the course examination will be by problem sets.

  The exact number of problem sets has not been decided, and depends
  on how many lectures the students will be required to scribe.

  As a rough guideline, fully scribing one lecture will count as the
  same amount of work as doing one problem set. Without any scribing,
  a course like this would normally have something like
  4 problem sets.

<!--  
  You have to pass all problem sets to pass the course.
-->

</p>




<em>
Links to the problem sets will appear as they are being posted.
</em>

</p>

<p>

<!--
<p>
    <em>
      Please note that the dates given below for future problem sets are still somewhat tentative.
    </em>
</p>    
-->

<p>
  <em>   
    The actual deadlines for the problem sets are somewhat configurable, and can be discussed
    in class.
    
    The important thing is that we all agree on the deadlines beforehand,
    and that once they are set we stick to them without exceptions.
  </em>

<h4><a name="pset-instructions"></a>Problem Set Instructions</h4>

<p>
  The following instructions apply for all problem sets.
</p>


<ol>

  <li>
    Please submit your solutions
    via e-mail
    as a PDF file.
    State your name and e-mail address 
    close to the top   of the first page.
    Solutions should be written in LaTeX or some other math-aware
    typesetting system with reasonable margins on all sides (at least 2.5&nbsp;cm).
    Please try to be precise and to the point in your solutions and
    refrain from vague statements.
    Never just state an an answer, but make
    sure to also explain your reasoning.
    <em>Write so that a fellow student of yours can read, understand, and
      verify your solutions.</em>
    
  <li>
    Submissions sohld be done on time.
    <!--
	Submissions must be done on time. Blank submissions are not
	acceptable and imply an automatic failure on the course.
      -->
    Note,
    however, that the submission deadline only specifies the date, and
    not the time zone. You are free to submit according to whatever
    time zone on earth you like, as long as the date in that time zone is correct.

  <li>
    The intention from the instructor side is to grade and return
    submissions
    <!-- after a week. -->
    within two weeks.

  <li>
    The thresholds for grading are stated on the first page of the
    problem set, and any adjustment of these thresholds will be
    communicated to students.
    (The thresholds can only be adjusted downwards and never upwards.)
    
  <li>
    You are strongly encouraged 
    to discuss the problem sets with other
    students, but you should write your own solution from scratch, and
    understand all details of them fully.
    It is not allowed to compose draft solutions together and
    then continue editing individually, or to share any text, formulas,
    or pseudocode. Also, no such material may be downloaded from the internet
    or generated via AI bots to be used in draft or final solutions.

  <li>
    Some of the problems will be "classic" and hence
    their solutions can probably be found on the Internet or in research
    papers.  It is not allowed to use such solutions in any way unless
    explicitly stated otherwise. 
    Anything said during the lectures on in the lecture notes should be fair
    game, though, unless you are specifically asked to show something
    that we claimed without proof in class.
