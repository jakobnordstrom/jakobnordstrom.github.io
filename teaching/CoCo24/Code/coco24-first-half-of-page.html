<h2><a name="short-overview">Short Overview of Course</a></h2>


<p>

Computers are everywhere today&mdash;at work, in our cars, in our
living rooms, and in our pockets&mdash;and have changed the world
beyond our wildest imagination. Yet these marvellous devices are, at
the core, amazingly simple and stupid: all they can do is to
mechanically shuffle zeros and ones around.

What is the true potential of
such automated computational devices? And what are the limits of what
<!-- kind of problems can be solved -->
can be done by mechanical calculations?

<p>

Computational complexity theory gives these deep and fascinating philosophical
questions a crisp mathematical meaning.

A <em>computational problem</em> is any task that is in principle amenable to
being solved by a computer&mdash;i.e., it can be solved by mechanical
application of mathematical steps.

Complexity theory focuses on classifying computational problems
according to their inherent difficulty, and on relating those classes
of problems to each other.

The goal is to understand the power of computers but also&mdash;and
above all&mdash;the limitations of what problems can be solved by
them, or more broadly by any type of automated computational process.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires
unreasonably large resources regardless of which approach is used to
solve it (i.e., no matter which algorithm is employed).  Complexity
theory formalizes this notion by introducing mathematical models of
computation and quantifying the amount of resources needed to solve
the problems, such as running time, memory usage, parallelism,
communication, et cetera.

<p>

This course will give an introduction to computational complexity
theory, survey some of the major research results, and present some of
the open problems that are the focus of current research. While the
intention is to give a fairly broad coverage, there might be a 
slight bias towards areas where the 
<a href="https://di.ku.dk/english/research/ac/"> Algorithms and
  Complexity Section</a>
at DIKU has made significant contributions to the state of the art.

<h2><a name="schedule">Schedule and Course Contents</a></h2>

<!-- START OF SCHEDULE SECTION -->

<p>

  This course
  is
  given in the first half of the spring semester (block 3) of 2024.
  
  It
  has
  a total of 22 lectures, with ca 2.5 lectures per week on average.


<p>

  In accordance with the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_quarter_(class_timing)">academic 
    quarter</a>
  tradition,
  all times are stated <em>cum tempore</em>,
  so
  10&nbsp;am 
  in the lecture schedule below
  actually means 10:15&nbsp;am et cetera. 
  
  The <strong>lectures</strong> will be in
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/Y5Ndp8sve377hAy58">Auditorium 01
    in the August Krogh Building</a>
  at Universitetsparken 13.
  
  In addition to the lectures, there are
  <strong>exercise classes</strong>
  all Thursdays 15-17 (except week 13) in
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/jwr4y7kNgMYxEpiF9">2.0.G.064/070
    in the Niels Bohr Building</a>
  at Jagtvej 155.

<p>

  Chapter numbers in the course planning below refer to the
  <a href="#AB09">Arora-Barak textbook</a>.
  
  The general idea behind the course
  is
  to go over (most of) the first 9 chapters in the
  <a href="#AB09">textbook</a>,
  getting a fairly good general overview of computational complexity theory,
  and then spend  roughly the last third of the course on a selection of more "advanced" topics,
  <!--
      such as 
      proof complexity, communication complexity, property testing, and 
      hardness of approximation 
    -->
  where the textbook 
  is
  followed less closely.
  
<p>

<!--  
  <em>Please note that the information below about what will be covered in
  future lectures is a bit tentative, since the planning might be
  slightly revised as we go along.</em>
  -->

<!--
The information below about the course planning (including what will
be covered in future lectures) should now be fairly stable.
