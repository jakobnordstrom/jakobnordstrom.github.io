  <!--
  The  lectures will cover the material in the articles
  that we need, so students are <strong><em>not</em></strong> required to read
  these papers&mdash;the references are provided for completeness and for
  students interested in further reading. However, for students interested in 
  learning more, it should be noted that many of the proofs given in
  class are actually <strong><em>not</em></strong> those found in the papers, and
  more recent survey papers of an area are likely to be better reads
  than the original research articles. Please do not hesitate to contact
  the instructor if you are interested in specific references for some
  specific area.
    -->
  
<!--
  Whenever available, the link is to the journal version (or full-length 
  technical report), which means that the date of the paper can be a few
  years later than that of the original conference publication.
-->

  <!--
<p>

Note that if you are not at the university, or if you are connected to the university
network via wireless, then you might not be able to access the PDF
files with the articles linked to above.
One way around this problem is to search for the titles of the papers  
in your favourite search engine&mdash;this should hopefully help you find
free versions of the same papers on the webpages of the
authors or similar.

    Problem Sets</h3>

<p>

  The course examination will be by a total of 4 problem sets.

  You have to pass all problem sets to pass the course.

  Problem sets will be posted on <em>Absalon</em> and below as the
  course proceeds, at least one week before the submission deadline.

<p>
  
<em>
Links to the problem sets will appear as they are being posted.
</em>

<p>

  <!--
<em>
  Please note that the dates given below for future problem sets are still somewhat tentative.
</em>

-->

<!--
<em>

The actual deadlines are somewhat configurable, and can be discussed
in class.

The important thing is that we all agree on the deadlines beforehand,
and that once they are set we stick to them without exceptions.

</ul>


<h3><a name="pset-instructions"></a>Problem Set Instructions</h3>

<p>
  The following instructions apply for all problem sets.
</p>


<ol>

  <li>
    Please submit your solutions
    via Absalon
    as a PDF file.
    State your name and e-mail address 
    close to the top   of the first page.
    Solutions should be written in LaTeX or some other math-aware
    typesetting system with reasonable margins on all sides (at least 2.5&nbsp;cm).
    Please try to be precise and to the point in your solutions and
    refrain from vague statements.
    Never just state an an answer, but make
    sure to also explain your reasoning.
    <em>Write so that a fellow student of yours can read, understand, and
      verify your solutions.</em>
    
  <li>
    Submissions must be done on time. Blank submissions are not
    acceptable and imply an automatic failure on the course.  Note,
    however, that the submission deadline only specifies the date, and
    not the time zone. You are free to submit according to whatever
    time zone on earth you like, as long as the date in that time zone is correct.

  <li>
    The intention from the instructor side is to grade and return
    submissions after a week.

  <li>
    The thresholds for grading are stated on the first page of the
    problem set, and any adjustment of these thresholds will be
    communicated on Absalon.  (The thresholds can only be adjusted
    downwards and never upwards.)

  <li>
    Students who do not pass a problem set can make a
    resubmission. Note that you can only resubmit solutions to
    problems on the problem set that you actually worked on
    before. That is, a resubmission can revise and correct a
    previously submitted solution for a problem, but cannot compensate
    for an initial blank submission for this problem.

  <li>
    The resubmission deadline is one week after the students have
    received their graded problem sets back, unless communicated otherwise.
    Resubmissions can only get grades in the lower half of the grading scale (up to C=7).

  <li>
    In order to pass the course, you need a passing grade on all problem sets.

  <li>
    In principle, the final grade will be the mean of the grades for all the problem sets.
    That is, think of A=12, B=10, C=7, D=4, and E=02 as {5,4,3,2,1}, sum up, and divide by the number of psets.
    If this mean is not integral, later psets will affect the rounding more than earlier psets.
    
  <li>
    <!-- 
	 No copying or sharing of text, code, or similar is allowed,
	 and also no use of chatbots.      
      -->
    Although you are encouraged to discuss the problem sets with other
    students, you have to write your own solution from scratch, and
    understand all details of them fully.
    It is not allowed to compose draft solutions together and
    then continue editing individually, or to share any text, formulas,
    or pseudocode. Also, no such material may be downloaded from or
    generated via the internet to be used in draft or final solutions.

</ol>

<p>
  
  <strong><em>Note that, as stated above,
      solutions to the problem sets should be handed in
      strictly by the deadlines</em></strong>. 

  Being able to work towards a deadline and deliver the best possible
  result within a given time frame (rather than a 100% polished product
  that arrives too late) is an important skill, and is something that
  you will have the opportunity to practise during the course.
  
  Having said that, 
  exceptional circumstances, such as severe
  illness, can be accepted as an excuse for late problem set
  solutions. It should be emphasized, however, that lack of time due to
  work outside the university or due to many parallel courses is
  <strong><em>not</em></strong> 
  considered as a legitimate reason for handing in problem
  set solutions late.  

  <em>If you feel that you have a good reason to hand in your
  solutions late, make sure to contact the main instructor as soon as
  possible.</em>
