<h1>
  1st International Workshop on Highlights in Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems
  (WHOOPS&nbsp;'24)
</h1>

<h2>

  Background
</h2>

<p>
  Since the turn of the millennium there have been dramatic
  improvements in algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization. The flipside of this is that as the methods get
  increasingly sophisticated, it becomes increasingly harder to
  avoid bugs sneaking in during algorithm design and implementation,
  and it is well documented that even the most mature tools sometimes
  return incorrect results. Software testing, while important, has not
  been sufficient to resolve this problem, and formal verification
  methods are far from being able to scale to the level of complexity
  in modern combinatorial solvers. During the last ten years the
  Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead
  successfully introduced
  <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer to a
  problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct.
  Such solvers are also referred to as <em>certifying algorithms</em>.
</p>

<p>

  For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger
  algorithmic paradigms such as SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
  constraint programming, and mixed integer linear programming
  met with very limited success.

  This has changed in the last few years with the
  introduction of
  <em>pseudo-Boolean (PB) proof logging</em>.  Pseudo-Boolean proofs
  operate with 0-1 integer linear inequalities using a version of the
  cutting planes proof system, but have turned out to be a very
  convenient format also for algorithms that reason in
  terms of very different concepts.  The
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  tool developed by the
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
      Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group in Copenhagen/Lund
  and its collaborators 
  has so far been shown to support efficient proof logging not only for
  advanced SAT solving techniques previously beyond reach (including
  symmetry breaking),
  but also for 
  MaxSAT solving, subgraph solving, constraint programming, and
  presolving techniques in 0-1 integer linear programming.

  <a href="https://youtu.be/s_5BIi4I22w"><em>VeriPB</em> tutorial</a>
  with
  <a href="../docs/presentations/TutorialProofLogging_Nov2022.pdf">accompanying slides</a> 
  for more information about this).
  -->
  <!--
  <em>VeriPB</em> is currently being used and developed by a growing
  number of research groups all over Europe.
  -->
</p>

<p>
  These developments have been so fast that the (somewhat spontaneous)
  idea has arisen to gather researchers from all over Europe working on
  pseudo-Boolean proof logging during the week May&nbsp;20-24
  in Copenhagen. The intention is to have an informal workshop where
  the attendees can learn about the latest news, hear about work that
  is ongoing right now, do networking, and plan for future
  collaborations. Reflecting the rather improvised nature of this
  event, it has been named the <em>1st Workshop on Highlights in
    Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems</em>, or
  <em>WHOOPS&nbsp;'24</em> for short.
  

<h2>
  <a name="program"></a>
  Workshop Program
</h2>

<p>
  During the first half of the week, we will have informal research
  discussions interleaved with a couple of longer seminars.
</p>

<p>
  On Thursday-Friday we will have a workshop with scheduled talks as
  listed below.

  The location will (tentatively) be somewhere in at the Department of
  Computer Science (DIKU) at the University of Copenhagen at
  <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/hvrzMQfWjHiQ5VDD8">Universitetsparken&nbsp;1</a>.
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    Please note that the schedule below is still tentative, and all titles
    are provisional.

<h2>
  <a name="about-miao"></a>About the MIAO Research Group</h2>

<p>  
  The
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
    Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group is based on both sides of the &Oslash;resund Bridge at
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>
  and the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>.

  The  group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems.
  
  This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct
  in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but
  where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and
  unexpected and exciting synergies often arise.
</p>

<p>
  We are closely affiliated with the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>,
  and are part of a world-leading environment in algorithms and
  complexity theory encompassing also the
  <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.

  We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious,
  creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of
  mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in
  algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational
  research, algorithms and complexity researchers in Copenhagen
  have a track record of surprising algorithmic
  discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
</p>

<!--

**********

<p>
  In the last few years we have also made
  research breakthroughs on how to verify the correctness of
  state-of-the-art algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization.  Such algorithms are often highly complex, and even
  mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes produce wrong
  results.

  Our goal is to usher in a new generation of <em>certifying</em>
  combinatorial solvers with so-called <em>proof logging</em>, meaning
  that the solvers output
  not only a result but also a simple, machine-verifiable
  proof that the claimed result is correct.
  For such a certifying solver, the workflow becomes as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Run the solver on a problem instance to obtain not only a
    computed result, but also a proof of correctness.
  </li><li>
    Feed the problem, the result, and the proof of correctness to a special,
    dedicated <em>proof checker</em> for verification.
  </li><li>
    Accept the result if the proof checker says that the proof is valid.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Importantly, these machine-verifiable proofs should be very easy to
  generate and should require low overhead on the solver side, but
  should also be very easy to check efficiently on the proof checker
  side, and should still provide 100% formal guarantees of
  correctness.

  This might sound just a little bit too good to be true, but the tool
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  that we have developed can now provide efficient proof logging for
  several combinatorial solving paradigms that have previously been beyond reach,
  and we have recently received several prestigious awards for our work.
