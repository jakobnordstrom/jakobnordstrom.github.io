<h2>

  Background and Purpose
</h2>

<p>
  Since the turn of the millennium there have been dramatic
  improvements in algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization. The flipside of this is that as the methods get
  increasingly sophisticated, it becomes increasingly harder to
  avoid bugs sneaking in during algorithm design and implementation,
  and it is well documented that even the most mature tools
  currently available sometimes
  return incorrect results. Software testing, while important, has not
  been sufficient to resolve this problem, and formal verification
  methods are far from being able to scale to the level of complexity
  in modern combinatorial solvers. During the last ten years the
  Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving community has instead
  successfully introduced
  <em>proof logging</em>,
  meaning that the SAT solvers have to output, along the answer to a
  problem, a machine-verifiable proof that this answer is correct.
  Such solvers are also referred to as <em>certifying algorithms</em>.
</p>

<p>

  For a long time, attempts to extend proof logging to stronger
  algorithmic paradigms such as SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT),
  constraint programming, and mixed integer linear programming
  have met with very limited success.

  This has changed in the last few years with the
  introduction of
  <em>pseudo-Boolean (PB) proof logging</em>.  Pseudo-Boolean proofs
  operate with 0-1 integer linear inequalities using a version of the
  cutting planes proof system, but have turned out to be a very
  convenient format also for algorithms that reason in
  terms of very different concepts.  The
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  tool developed by the
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
      Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group in Copenhagen/Lund
  and its collaborators 
  has so far been shown to support efficient proof logging not only for
  advanced SAT solving techniques previously beyond reach (including
  symmetry breaking),
  but also for 
  MaxSAT solving, subgraph solving, constraint programming, and
  presolving techniques in 0-1 integer linear programming.

  for more information about this).
  -->
  <!--
  <em>VeriPB</em> is currently being used and developed by a growing
  number of research groups all over Europe.
  -->
</p>

<p>
  These developments have been so fast that the (somewhat spontaneous)
  idea has arisen to gather researchers from all over Europe working on
  pseudo-Boolean proof logging during the week May&nbsp;20-24
  in Copenhagen. The intention is to have an informal workshop where
  the attendees can learn about the latest news, hear about work that
  is ongoing right now, do networking, and plan for future
  collaborations. Reflecting the rather improvised nature of this
  event, it has been named the <em>1st Workshop on Highlights in
    Organizing and Optimizing Proof-logging Systems</em>, or
  <em>WHOOPS&nbsp;'24</em> for short.

<h3>
  <a name="jakob-nordström">Jakob Nordström:</a>
  A one-size-fits-all proof logging system? 	
</h3>

<p>
  This talk is intended to give an overview of <em>VeriPB</em>, a proof system based on pseudo-Boolean reasoning with 0-1 integer linear inequalities that seems well suited to provide a unified proof logging method for discrete combinatorial problems. We have implemented <em>VeriPB</em> proof logging, together with efficient proof checking, for state-of-the-art solvers in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving, SAT-based optimization (MaxSAT solving), graph solving, constraint programming, and a growing list of other combinatorial solving paradigms. We believe there are reasons to hope that ideas from <em>VeriPB</em> could be useful also in the context of mixed integer linear programming, satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solving, automated planning, and possibly also other combinatorial solving paradigms, and will briefly review these and other future research directions in pseudo-Boolean proof logging.
</p>

<p>
Based on joint work with Jeremias Berg, Bart Bogaerts, Jan Elffers, Ambros Gleixner, Stephan Gocht, Alexander Hoen, Hannes Ihalainen, Matti Järvisalo, Ciaran McCreesh, Matthew McIlree, Magnus O. Myreen, Andy Oertel, Yong Kiam Tan, and Dieter Vandesande.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="bart-bogaerts">Bart Bogaerts:</a>
  Certified Symmetry Breaking with <em>VeriPB</em> 
</h3>

<p>
I will start by giving an overview of (static and dynamic) symmetry handling methods for SAT. Next, I will dive into details about strengthening rules in the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system and discuss every step of a detailed worked example, demonstrating how to do fully automated static symmetry breaking for SAT in a certified way.
Finally, I will discuss an open challenge on how to get certification for a framework such as SAT modulo symmetries, and particularly, the question of what it even means to certify this method. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="ciaran-mccreesh">Ciaran McCreesh:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof logging for things that aren't pseudo-Boolean
</h3>

<p>
We've heard a lot about pseudo-Boolean proof logging, but what do we do if our problems aren't pseudo-Boolean and our solvers don't search for cutting planes proofs? I'll showcase a range of applications where <em>VeriPB</em> has been successfully deployed, including subgraph problems like maximum clique and subgraph isomorphism; constraint programming; and if time permits, dynamic programming. These results suggest that for some reason, extended cutting planes seems to be a really helpful way of certifying a wide range of techniques used in combinatorial solving algorithms.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="matthew-mcilree">Matthew McIlree:</a>
  Proof logging for some interesting constraint propagation algorithms
</h3>

<p>
In this talk, I will explain some non-trivial propagators used in constraint programming solvers, and describe how they can be modified to justify their reasoning within the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system. 
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="dieter-vandesande">Dieter Vandesande:</a>
  Proof logging for <em>MaxCDCL</em> and BDDs
</h3>

<p>
In earlier work, MaxSAT solvers implementing both solution-improving and core-guided search have been made certifying using the <em>VeriPB</em> proof system. In this talk, I will show the recent developments and ongoing work on proof logging a solver implementing a third solving paradigm: Branch-and-Bound search. More specifically, will we cover the solver <em>MaxCDCL</em>, which combines Branch-and-Bound search with the power of clause learning as it is implemented in SAT solvers. <em>MaxCDCL</em> also makes use of a PB-to-CNF encoding based on BDD's, and we will also show how to provide proof logging for that.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="hannes-ihalainen">Hannes Ihalainen:</a>
  Certified MaxSAT preprocessing
</h3>

<p>
Building on the progress in Boolean satisfiability (SAT) solving over the last decades, maximum satisfiability (MaxSAT) has become a viable approach for solving NP-hard optimization problems. However, ensuring correctness of MaxSAT solvers has remained a considerable concern. For SAT, this is largely a solved problem thanks to the use of proof logging, meaning that solvers emit machine-verifiable proofs to certify correctness. However, for MaxSAT, proof logging solvers have started being developed only very recently. Moreover, these nascent efforts have only targeted the core solving process, ignoring the preprocessing phase where input problem instances can be substantially reformulated before being passed on to the solver proper.
</p>

<p>
In this work, we demonstrate how pseudo-Boolean proof logging can be used to certify the correctness of a wide range of modern MaxSAT preprocessing techniques. By combining and extending the <em>VeriPB</em> and <em>CakePB</em> tools, we provide formally verified end-to-end proof checking that the input and preprocessed output MaxSAT problem instances have the same optimal value. An extensive evaluation on applied MaxSAT benchmarks shows that our approach is feasible in practice.
</p>

<p>
The talk is based on work: Hannes Ihalainen, Andy Oertel, Yong Kiam Tan, Jeremias Berg, Matti Järvisalo, Magnus O. Myreen, and Jakob Nordström: Certified MaxSAT Preprocessing. IJCAR 2024.

<h3>
  <a name="andy-oertel">Andy Oertel:</a>
  Certifying MIP-based presolve reductions for 0–1 integer linear programs
</h3>

<p>
It is well known that reformulating the original problem can be crucial for the performance of mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers. To ensure correctness, all transformations must preserve the feasibility status and optimal value of the problem, but there is currently no established methodology to express and verify the equivalence of two mixed-integer programs. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by showing how the correctness of MIP presolve reductions on 0-1 integer linear programs can be certified by using (and suitably extending) the <em>VeriPB</em> tool for pseudo-Boolean proof logging. Our experimental evaluation on both decision and optimization instances demonstrates the computational viability of the approach and leads to suggestions for future revisions of the proof format that will help to reduce the verbosity of the certificates and to accelerate the certification and verification process further.
</p>

  <a name="joseph-loughney">Joseph Loughney:</a>
  Symmetry breaking in the subgraph isomorphism problem
</h3>

<p>
The Subgraph Isomorphism Problem has many applications, including bioinformatics, computer vision and graph databases. Current state-of-the-art solvers using constraints programming techniques can handle cases with up to 1000 pattern vertices and 10,000 target vertices. Symmetry breaking techniques have shown promising results in improving the efficiency of algorithms for similar combinatorial problems; presented here are two strategies for implementing symmetry breaking using stabiliser chains, alongside initial experimental results.
</p>

<h3>
  <a name="arthur-gontier">Arthur Gontier:</a>
  Pseudo-Boolean proof trimming
</h3>

<p>
Proof trimming may be used to get a smaller proof, a shorter verification time or to gain some knowledge on the solving method that generated the proof. In this talk, we will present some early results of a trimmer we made for CP proofs on Subgraph Isomorphism Problems, and we open the discussion on several trimming ideas.

<p>  
  The
  <em><a href="https://jakobnordstrom.se/miao-group/"> Mathematical Insights into
    Algorithms for Optimization (MIAO)</a></em>
  research group is based on both sides of the &Oslash;resund Bridge at the
  <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>
  and
  <a href="https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/">Lund University</a>.

  The  group has a unique profile in that we are doing
  cutting-edge research both on the mathematical foundations of
  efficient computation and on state-of-the-art practical algorithms
  for real-world problems.
  
  This creates a very special environment, where we do not only conduct
  in-depth research on different theoretical and applied topics, but
  where different lines of research cross-fertilise each other and
  unexpected and exciting synergies often arise.
</p>

<p>
  We are closely affiliated with the
  <a href="https://barc.ku.dk/">Basic Algorithms Research Copenhagen (BARC) centre</a>,
  and are part of a world-leading environment in algorithms and
  complexity theory encompassing also the
  <a href="https://en.itu.dk/">IT University of Copenhagen</a> and the
  <a href="https://www.dtu.dk/english">Technical University of Denmark (DTU)</a>.

  We aim to attract top talent from around the world to an ambitious,
  creative, collaborative, and fun environment. Using the power of
  mathematics, we strive to create fundamental breakthroughs in
  algorithms and complexity theory. While the focus in on foundational
  research, algorithms and complexity researchers in Copenhagen
  have a track record of surprising algorithmic
  discoveries leading to major industrial applications.
</p>

<!--

**********

<p>
  In the last few years we have also made
  research breakthroughs on how to verify the correctness of
  state-of-the-art algorithms for combinatorial solving and
  optimization.  Such algorithms are often highly complex, and even
  mature commercial solvers are known to sometimes produce wrong
  results.

  Our goal is to usher in a new generation of <em>certifying</em>
  combinatorial solvers with so-called <em>proof logging</em>, meaning
  that the solvers output
  not only a result but also a simple, machine-verifiable
  proof that the claimed result is correct.
  For such a certifying solver, the workflow becomes as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Run the solver on a problem instance to obtain not only a
    computed result, but also a proof of correctness.
  </li><li>
    Feed the problem, the result, and the proof of correctness to a special,
    dedicated <em>proof checker</em> for verification.
  </li><li>
    Accept the result if the proof checker says that the proof is valid.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Importantly, these machine-verifiable proofs should be very easy to
  generate and should require low overhead on the solver side, but
  should also be very easy to check efficiently on the proof checker
  side, and should still provide 100% formal guarantees of
  correctness.

  This might sound just a little bit too good to be true, but the tool
  <em><a href="https://gitlab.com/MIAOresearch/software/VeriPB">VeriPB</a></em>
  that we have developed can now provide efficient proof logging for
  several combinatorial solving paradigms that have previously been beyond reach,
  and we have recently received several prestigious awards for our work.
